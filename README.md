llama-rag.py uses local ollama llama3.2 if it is installed in the machine
grok-wiki.py uses grok-ai to answer questions related to some formula one questions sourcing wikipedia
grok-wiki2.py is a cleaner version of grok-wiki.py
userwiki.py allows the user to mention the wikipedia page name and ask any question (use this)
