The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.\nA points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors\u2014now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.\nFormula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.\nWith the average annual cost of running a team\u2014e.g. designing, building, and maintaining cars; staff payroll; transport\u2014at approximately \u00a3220 million, Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported.

The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start. Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.\nThe first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957. This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.\n\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times. Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered\u2014still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.\nThis era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1908, "end_char_idx": 4777, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "702a9b4d-9709-421a-9ced-121a7e3bfdfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "702a9b4d-9709-421a-9ced-121a7e3bfdfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e90e1b2d-e05a-4753-85bb-b8d68f3938b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f9cb2004343712d0b0f9a91dc77279eb1a13aa5559aa3b64630df179b80a3d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b6b0388-0129-4046-aec4-18b7f59eff7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e860c8cf5d550bc090f2fb4e9d271e25f45db9f2005f7c3ef4728e73dec5a6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Technological developments ===\n\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.\nDuring 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.\nIn 1968, sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1968. Five months later, the first works team, Lotus, initially using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red, gold, and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.\nAerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.\n\n\n=== Big business ===\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multi-billion dollar business it now is. When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA. He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.\nThe formation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA\u2013FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations. The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley \"used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view\". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races. The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations. Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.\nFISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983. But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar. These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in 1989.\nThe development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4780, "end_char_idx": 9274, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b6b0388-0129-4046-aec4-18b7f59eff7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b6b0388-0129-4046-aec4-18b7f59eff7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "702a9b4d-9709-421a-9ced-121a7e3bfdfa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da7f4ac76986b597f84bcebea63be069b43d95eddb5b8d5638c97b81859165a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14b1ba17-6436-440f-b24f-a12b9f1ea925", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61471cb6845d634fcfd4ade91089607b0fd7723ce39d0246bb66259ec3b4db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.

Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".\nThe teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.\n\nOn the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, one at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSince Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams\u2014most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.\n\nResults were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship from 1979 to 2008, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8576, "end_char_idx": 13057, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14b1ba17-6436-440f-b24f-a12b9f1ea925": {"__data__": {"id_": "14b1ba17-6436-440f-b24f-a12b9f1ea925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b6b0388-0129-4046-aec4-18b7f59eff7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e860c8cf5d550bc090f2fb4e9d271e25f45db9f2005f7c3ef4728e73dec5a6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "64aa7acd-7f81-4956-b9e5-f5406ce69b2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f833747fc47a0920bf04b1c9880d2c2a1cac5f577ba073ca86052729178a8380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.\n\n\n=== Manufacturers' return ===\n Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000\u20132004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999\u20132004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021). Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\nDuring this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs. Team orders, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A 'tyre war' between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall, although, at the 2005 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20 December 2007 Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.\nDuring 2006, Max Mosley outlined a 'green' future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor.\nStarting in 2000, with Ford's purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo's and Renault's departures in 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams\u2014Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and Ferrari\u2014dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz. Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12240, "end_char_idx": 16151, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64aa7acd-7f81-4956-b9e5-f5406ce69b2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "64aa7acd-7f81-4956-b9e5-f5406ce69b2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14b1ba17-6436-440f-b24f-a12b9f1ea925", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61471cb6845d634fcfd4ade91089607b0fd7723ce39d0246bb66259ec3b4db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "244083cd-435c-4a00-876c-65866a3ca5f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "878d080082de3775027e6cabe5ddcc1029dbd71300732283ee8d28acc68a04c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Manufacturers' decline and return of the privateers ===\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors. But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.\nMcLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road car project and tough F1 championships, which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on Ferrari). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.\nDuring the 2009 season, Formula One was gripped by the FIA\u2013FOTA dispute. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams; teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a rev limiter. The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and Force India, that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.\n\nOn 24 June, Formula One's governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified, and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October. Following further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection, FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season, and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting. On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus\u2014led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing\u2014the first Spanish Formula One team; and Virgin Racing\u2014Richard Branson's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams\u2014which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams\u2014ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.\n\n\n=== Hybrid era ===\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in 2015 before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16154, "end_char_idx": 20767, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "244083cd-435c-4a00-876c-65866a3ca5f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "244083cd-435c-4a00-876c-65866a3ca5f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64aa7acd-7f81-4956-b9e5-f5406ce69b2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f833747fc47a0920bf04b1c9880d2c2a1cac5f577ba073ca86052729178a8380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "265183ea-3816-468f-abee-a960bd10f6d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "65d3c18457c9c3b5bbae20d47506acfd1e1a7f2a0bd5b23a243c61fa1fb43733", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Hybrid era ===\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units.

The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain.\n\nAfter revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the 2017 and 2018 seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari. Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years, eventually winning seven consecutive Drivers' Championships from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. During this eight-year period between 2014 and 2021, a Mercedes driver won 111 of the 160 races, with Hamilton winning 81 of these and taking six Drivers' Championships during this period to equal Schumacher's record of seven titles. In 2021, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.\nThis era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda's return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the Lotus F1 Team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season, while Racing Point part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for 2021. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022, with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced. The start of the 2020 season was delayed by several months, and both it and 2021 seasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing.\nIn 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations. Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The 2022 and 2023 Constructors' and Drivers' Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.\nIn 2023 the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula 1 in the then near future. Of the teams that applied, only Andretti were approved by the FIA, with them then being rejected by Formula One Management, though they have launched an appeal.\nIn early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake.com, resulting in the team's new identity as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber. Sauber will hold Stake's sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards. Scuderia AlphaTauri, Red Bull's junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming Visa Cash App RB, or VCARB for 2024.

From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race. As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix, whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards' discretion.\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix. The system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the 'sprint'. From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout'; such a system made its debut at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres \u2013 mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 \u2013 otherwise they cannot participate in the session.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25259, "end_char_idx": 30717, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd2ab696-96a9-4831-8b01-53767c6c8405": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd2ab696-96a9-4831-8b01-53767c6c8405", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90caa944-3cbf-4756-9373-ac7d1e3f5952", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09cb3a4837c0726ddcfe3c160a75c08ffb9f0c563c91a5b13d5f738ca177eb3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d46a0b6-4a6a-4631-8527-38e97c5dfbaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00d4e76697ca831cac4204737832be74018f2eceb9c7897dd36bed15ed751977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Race ===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardized to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989, with the exception of the Monaco Grand Prix, which has a shorter distance due to its slower speeds and the need to keep the race under two hours.\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\". Drivers who are about to be lapped are supposed to literally go out of their way and let the \"lapping\" driver pass easily. Research documents that drivers - despite being supposed to - often do not defer to the lapping driver and engage in resistance. Once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\nThroughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential.

As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers. The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations. As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.\n\n\n==== Safety car ====\n\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with no overtaking permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a rolling start. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pit lane, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\nMercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996. From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage to share duties with Mercedes-AMGs.\n\nSince 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder. He is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.\n\n\n===== Virtual Safety Car =====\n\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimise the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags. When the virtual safety car is deployed, the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\". All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta.

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem \u2013 in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations.\nSince the 2010 season, refuelling \u2013 which was reintroduced in 1994 \u2013 has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n\n=== Points system ===\n\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers' Championship.\nA driver must be classified in order to receive points, as of 2022, a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.\nFrom some time between the 1977 and 1980 seasons to the end of the 2021 season if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the 1984 season. The last occurrence was at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car because of torrential rain. The half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent gradual scale system for 2022.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 37919, "end_char_idx": 41315, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df117db3-24e4-479a-b007-dac5567192e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "df117db3-24e4-479a-b007-dac5567192e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e667c727-ba73-4178-8d10-2d305db50025", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ba556b57835c0b5bb6e0e0e6e3dcc1bcfcffe5ddaf39cd24e4898e4f7f676b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1fd2bf77-2e5b-4ddc-8ee0-95bc8a2b92eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aae7f2fc4ae4226991779cd8f4e300688623ec23bfa5068caf253302ec3e6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Constructors ==\n\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine. If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983). Constructors that share the engine with another constructor pay close attention - not just to their own performance - but also to the performance of other constructors using the same engine when assessing whether to extend their collaboration with an engine manufacturer.\nSince 1981, Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the distinction between the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced by a different entity. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"spec series\" such as Formula 2 which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits privateers, which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\nThe sport's debut season, 1950, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"works team\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen).\nCompanies such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertec, which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier. It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200 million ($125\u2013$225 million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams. Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis, The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT team in 2010 and Haas currently.\nAlthough teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated they range from US$66 million to US$400 million each.\nEntering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $200 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams. As a consequence, constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: BAR's purchase of Tyrrell and Midland's purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had, such as TV revenue.\nSeven out of the ten teams competing in Formula One are based in England, in an area centred around Oxford. Ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. The RB Formula One Team is based close to Ferrari in Faenza, whilst Sauber Motorsport is based near Zurich in Switzerland.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41318, "end_char_idx": 45631, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fd2bf77-2e5b-4ddc-8ee0-95bc8a2b92eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fd2bf77-2e5b-4ddc-8ee0-95bc8a2b92eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "df117db3-24e4-479a-b007-dac5567192e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b63a20d4c78aacaf0b378592c0156a121cc58a55d2d07a1218e1ca37da4febd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fef5ddf-659f-4d03-9cee-058f34f7bb9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b236377b33c3cd6f247539a4b34bddda55c6ff796e1744d45357dbeface14a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Drivers ==\n\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria. Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\nTeams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers' role mainly takes places on a simulator, such as rFpro, which is used by most of the F1 teams.\nEach driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi) upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one. At the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.\nPermanent numbers were introduced in 1973 to take effect in 1974, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13 which had been unused since 1976.\n\nAs teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari's 27 and 28. A different system was used from 1996 to 2013: at the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season's Constructors' Championship order.\nAs of 2024, a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too, in 2020. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers, and 319 wins.\n\n\n=== Physical demands ===\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2\u20134 kg (4\u20139 lb) of weight per race. A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 gs when cornering, 6 gs when braking and 2 gs when accelerating. When a driver experiences 6 g, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb). Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing. The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40\u201350 newton-metres (30\u201337 lb\u22c5ft), while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal. Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance. Drivers also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can average more than 170 bpm during a race; this is more than a healthy adult would typically experience while running.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45634, "end_char_idx": 50462, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fef5ddf-659f-4d03-9cee-058f34f7bb9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fef5ddf-659f-4d03-9cee-058f34f7bb9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1fd2bf77-2e5b-4ddc-8ee0-95bc8a2b92eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aae7f2fc4ae4226991779cd8f4e300688623ec23bfa5068caf253302ec3e6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ccd91165-8aa5-4766-b473-8a7f943a3715", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2246a14b592ae77958d80bb701a281fc1ea53584bc54474ff601e8fd35a19280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Feeder series ===\n\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions and then progress through traditional entry level European single-seater series such as Formula Ford, Formula Renault, and Formula 4. From there, drivers typically progress to higher level regional championships at the Formula Three level. This included championships like British F3 and European F3 historically, although similar series now hold the Formula Regional designation. In addition to this, there are also international F3 championships, including GP3 and its present-day successor FIA F3. The highest level series on the F1 ladder is the FIA Formula 2 Championship. In the past, the top level series was GP2 (2005\u20132016), International Formula 3000 (1985\u20132004 under the Formula 3000 class), and Formula Two (1948\u20131984).\nDrivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika H\u00e4kkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One, and Max Verstappen made his F1 debut following a single season in European F3. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.\nAmerican open-wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid. CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F1 World Champions, while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F1.\n\n\n== Grands Prix ==\n\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2024 season contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season. There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races.\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953, and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in 1958. Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in 1976 and Australia in 1985), and the first race in the Middle East was held in 2004. The 19 races of the 2014 season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.\nSome of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night race in 2008, which was followed by the day\u2013night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.\n\n\n=== Contracted Grands Prix ===\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50465, "end_char_idx": 54660, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccd91165-8aa5-4766-b473-8a7f943a3715": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccd91165-8aa5-4766-b473-8a7f943a3715", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fef5ddf-659f-4d03-9cee-058f34f7bb9d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b236377b33c3cd6f247539a4b34bddda55c6ff796e1744d45357dbeface14a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68a3545d-612f-443f-9afe-f299a0858ab1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "765a9617160b5f4c440056cce97aa81c0ea0d21b7a3e0abb54066a83cebe989d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Contracted Grands Prix ===\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.\n\n\n=== Returning additions (2008\u2013present) ===\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\n\nEuropean Grand Prix at Valencia Street Circuit (2008\u20132012)\nUnited States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (2012\u20132019, 2021\u2013present)\nAustrian Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring (2014\u2013present)\nMexican Grand Prix at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez (2015\u20132019); renamed Mexico City Grand Prix (2021\u2013present)\nEuropean Grand Prix at Baku City Circuit (2016; renamed the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for 2017\u20132019, 2021\u2013present)\nFrench Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard (2018\u20132019, 2021\u20132022)\nPortuguese Grand Prix at Algarve International Circuit (2020\u20132021)\nImola Circuit with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix (2020\u20132022, 2024\u2013present; previously hosted the Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix)\nDutch Grand Prix at Circuit Zandvoort (2021\u2013present)\n\n\n=== New Locations Initiative (2008\u2013present) ===\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\nSince 2008, the Formula One Group has been targeting new \"destination cities\" to expand its global reach, with the aim to produce races from countries that have not previously been involved in the sport. This initiative started with the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\n\n== Circuits ==\n\nFormula One races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks. The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations. In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\nA typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars. Special pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\". The Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA's minimum race distance requirement\u2014the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit, added in 2004 and designed \u2013 like most of F1's new circuits \u2013 by Hermann Tilke. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\nThe Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996. In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985. The Las Vegas Grand Prix entered the sport in 2023.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54314, "end_char_idx": 58823, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68a3545d-612f-443f-9afe-f299a0858ab1": {"__data__": {"id_": "68a3545d-612f-443f-9afe-f299a0858ab1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccd91165-8aa5-4766-b473-8a7f943a3715", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2246a14b592ae77958d80bb701a281fc1ea53584bc54474ff601e8fd35a19280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "328553ca-051a-4950-a1b9-beeaca21b019", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "623b0179d4457daac4dbe0320e767990931e760afd89c8c9fc27d79df58594f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Cars and technology ==\n\nModern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters. The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 800 kg (1,800 lb) \u2013 the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.\nThe cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From 1998 to 2008, the tyres in Formula One were not \"slicks\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars. Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the 2009 season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis \u2013 one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their 2012 car. Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In 2022, McLaren (MCL36) and Red Bull Racing (RB18) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.\nCarbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for maximum performance and cooling.\nIn 2022, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence (commonly referred to as \"dirty air\") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the turbulent air. (See 2022 Formula One World Championship Technical regulations)\nFormula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction. As of 2022, the wheels are covered with \"spec\" (Standardised) Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the \"tyre profile\"), and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.\n\nStarting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units. These get a significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol. The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000 rpm and produced over 580 kW (780 bhp). For 2007, engines were restricted to 19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since the end of 2006.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58826, "end_char_idx": 63383, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "328553ca-051a-4950-a1b9-beeaca21b019": {"__data__": {"id_": "328553ca-051a-4950-a1b9-beeaca21b019", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "68a3545d-612f-443f-9afe-f299a0858ab1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "765a9617160b5f4c440056cce97aa81c0ea0d21b7a3e0abb54066a83cebe989d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "388ea8cd-c07a-42c2-99af-a487672984c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c149375eba6fcd7786dff672738e671170c01de506212655153364841dee922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Starting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units.

For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000 rpm.\nA wide variety of technologies \u2013 including active suspension are banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h (220 mph) at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. During qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph). A BAR-Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.\nEven with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to \"drive on the ceiling\", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering. Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around 1g.\nAs of 2019, each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time. Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team. If more engines are used, they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used. The only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season, in which case up to five may be used by a driver.

The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.\nCosts vary greatly from team to team. Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $200 million on engines in 2006, Renault spent approximately $125 million and Cosworth's 2006 V8 was developed for $15 million. In contrast to the 2006 season on which these figures are based, the 2007 sporting regulations banned all performance-related engine development.\nFormula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors' Championship. Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee, which in 2013 was \u20ac10,000 plus \u20ac1,000 per point.\nThere have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015, Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.\nThe cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as Albert Park, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as MotoGP. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300 million and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150 million to build.\nA number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing. The highest-paid driver in 2021 is Lewis Hamilton, who received $55 million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 \u2013 a record for any driver. The very top Formula One drivers get paid more than IndyCar or NASCAR drivers; however, the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F1 drivers, and the majority of NASCAR racers will make more money than their F1 counterparts. Most top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122 million and an income of $24 million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company grossed revenues of $620 million for the same quarter the previous year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 64993, "end_char_idx": 68761, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b55aafc-8710-44b4-a536-93409b4fb2d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b55aafc-8710-44b4-a536-93409b4fb2d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "388ea8cd-c07a-42c2-99af-a487672984c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c149375eba6fcd7786dff672738e671170c01de506212655153364841dee922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "45e9c158-793b-4033-915c-5c191c574fbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba6d0a5ea2bc435230c66ecdf8268a5cd8ba23ac49cd9ad5f14c541f1c4a51ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Cost cap ===\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport's governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.\nFor instance, in 2019, the richest teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari spent $420 million and $435 million respectively, whereas teams such as Williams or Haas, only spent $125 million and $150 million respectively. This gap was widening by the season and disparities like this prompted the FIA to introduce a cost cap in February 2021.\nThe FIA proposed the cost cap as a measure to reward engineering prowess over sheer expenditure. They did this in an effort to bridge the gap between the midfield teams and the teams challenging for the driver's and constructors' titles.\nThe cap was $175 million in 2021, although was reduced further to $145 million in response to economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2022, the cost cap was further reduced to $140 million and in 2023 it fell to $135 million where it will remain for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.\nThe 2022 season served as a critical test for the effectiveness of the cost cap as it was the year the new regulations were introduced, allowing all teams to start from scratch and build a car that was independent of the previous years. Critics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient to close the gap in competition because it excluded certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs along with loopholes that allowed the likes of Adrian Newey's salary of Red Bull to be excluded from the cost cap. They also contended that established teams could exploit existing infrastructures and resources accumulated over years, thus maintaining their competitive edge despite the spending limits.\nHowever, an alternative perspective highlights that the cost cap encourages teams to maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the 2023 season as the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points with Lando Norris at P17 and Oscar Piastri at P20. Seven months later, with the right upgrades, they managed to be the fastest car on the grid throughout qualifying and race pace. Facing budgetary constraints similar to their competitors, McLaren focused on strategic engineering upgrades and talent development. Their significant mid-season improvements led to notable on-track success, demonstrating that with clever resource management and engineering talent, teams can challenge the dominance of traditionally wealthier competitors.\nMcLaren CEO Zak Brown said that \"the cap has been outstanding for the sport.\" He also went on to say that there is a feeling that at any point in the season, any team can challenge for a place it wasn't equipped to do so at the start of the season.\nThe critics have expressed that the impact of the cost cap suggests that engineering excellence and strategic ingenuity can indeed offset the advantages of larger budgets. By promoting a more balanced competitive environment, the cost cap has made Formula 1 more exciting for fans and more viable for teams.\n\n\n== Future ==\n\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.\nFollowing their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in 2017, Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport's relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.\nOn 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement.

This came into effect at the start of the 2021 season and changed how prize money and TV revenue is distributed.\n\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nFormula One has initiated a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. By 2025, all events should have become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.\nA report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the 2019 season, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and only 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: \"As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations. We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards.\"\nFrom the 2021\u201322 season, all cars increased the bio-component of their fuel, using E10 fuel, rather than the 5.75% of ethanol previously used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future. In December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability, to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.\n\n\n=== Social inequities ===\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative. The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\". The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport. The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007.\nIn addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport's cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white. Due to the results of the study, the team changed the car's livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 2025.\nThe 20 drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track. Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore \"End Racism\" shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities. In the year since, Lewis Hamilton has remained vocal in his pre-race attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.\n\n\n== Women in Formula One ==\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score. The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019, 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 72061, "end_char_idx": 76967, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8af0132-6877-4093-9336-9d4de2ec4590": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8af0132-6877-4093-9336-9d4de2ec4590", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45e9c158-793b-4033-915c-5c191c574fbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba6d0a5ea2bc435230c66ecdf8268a5cd8ba23ac49cd9ad5f14c541f1c4a51ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc506d63-92ac-4ccb-84b6-d852a820d762", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31c3c8ad869937188a3529b9839c576f9f88cc3111560f0d8f46bc77d2cf87b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Women in Formula One ==\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score.

Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garc\u00eda of Prema Racing. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport; Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.\n\n\n=== Female Formula One drivers ===\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first woman to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.\nLella Lombardi is the only woman to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races, and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, Lombardi became the first and only woman to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion half points were awarded and Lombardi only gained .5 points.\nDesir\u00e9 Wilson is the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the 1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship.\nGiovanna Amati was the last female driver to attempt to qualify for a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1992, she was signed by Brabham and participated in three races\u2014South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil\u2014but failed to qualify for any of them. Amati faced significant challenges, including an underperforming car and limited testing opportunities. She was replaced by Damon Hill after Brabham struggled with financial difficulties and performance issues. Despite not making a race start, her entry remains significant, as no woman has attempted to qualify for a Grand Prix since. Her participation also marked the last time a female driver was officially listed on an F1 entry list until Susie Wolff took part in free practice sessions for Williams in 2014.\n\n\n=== Race engineers ===\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing.\nBeginning in 2025, Laura M\u00fcller has served as the race engineer for Esteban Ocon at Haas, making her the first female to serve as a race engineer on a full time basis.\n\n\n=== Team principals ===\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing. In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\nAustrian Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first ever female Team principal when she took over the role at Sauber Formula 1 Team in 2010.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 76468, "end_char_idx": 80410, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc506d63-92ac-4ccb-84b6-d852a820d762": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc506d63-92ac-4ccb-84b6-d852a820d762", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8af0132-6877-4093-9336-9d4de2ec4590", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e003247ec375d2d415b50a8d550512243130b5c04fddde49ca112a487f98c68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fe67956-087b-41a4-bae8-97c82d68a1e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f34a009cd8923e4cfabd3dbb5cfcfdb0ef30d8af27915cce613d44dd41b63ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Team principals ===\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades.

The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race. The cumulative television audience for the 2001 season, which was broadcast to 200 territories, was calculated to be 54 billion.\nDuring the early 1990s, Formula One Group introduced updated branding, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website in an attempt to give the competition a corporate identity.\nAll broadcasters are provided with an identical world feed produced by Formula One Management (FOM), though for some races it was previously provided by local broadcasters. The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds \u2013 a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\nAn enhanced package called F1 Digital+ was launched by FOM in 1996, which included live broadcast of all sessions live as well as additional channels including onboard and pit-lane cameras. It was initially only offered in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, though it later became available in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The service was never financially viable and was discontinued at the end of the 2002 season.\nOn 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the HD format for the 2011 season.\nThe official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store since 2009, and on Google Play since 2011, that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary. On 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous \"flying one\" in use since 1993.\nIn March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary. In April 2024, FOM launched a free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States, which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 79594, "end_char_idx": 83050, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fe67956-087b-41a4-bae8-97c82d68a1e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fe67956-087b-41a4-bae8-97c82d68a1e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc506d63-92ac-4ccb-84b6-d852a820d762", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31c3c8ad869937188a3529b9839c576f9f88cc3111560f0d8f46bc77d2cf87b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd5f5fd6-fb9f-4845-a5d0-234f603c6ae1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14e2603c90768025b74b5d2113b9ea772b9fadb942646566ff137bfca2d3f2d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Television broadcasters ===\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 from 2012 to 2018. Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1 which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows. In 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season. The BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season, three years earlier than planned. The free-to-air TV rights were picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season. Sky Sports F1 coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra coverage was extended until 2021. As of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until 2024.\nIn south-east Asia, the middle east and north Africa, Formula One is broadcast by beIN Sports. In India, sessions are broadcast by streaming service FanCode and satellite television provider Tata Play. In China, the rights are held by Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV.\nIn the United States, ESPN has held the rights since 2013, carrying the broadcast and commentary feed provided by Sky Sports UK. Some races are also broadcast free-to-air on ABC under the ESPN on ABC banner. According to The Athletic, the fee paid by ESPN is estimated at $90 million per year as of 2025, with the current deal set to expire after the 2025 season.\nIn Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the exclusive rights are held by pay TV broadcaster Sky Sport. The rights were previously shared with free-to-air channel RTL for many years, which had broadcast all Formula One qualifying and racing sessions since 1991, but lost its rights after the 2020 season due to being outbid by Sky Sport. Despite no longer holding the rights themselves, RTL has broadcast selected sessions on free-to-air television and its streaming service RTL+ as part of various sublicensing agreements with Sky Sport.\nIn France, Formula One is currently broadcast by pay TV channel Canal+, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.\n\n\n== Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races ==\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous. Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations. However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\n\nThe first Formula One race was held in 1946, whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship; in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the 1983 Race of Champions.\nThe World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\nThe World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e. without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 race counted towards the World Championship. This race was run to American Automobile Association, and later United States Automobile Club, Championship Car regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, Alberto Ascari in 1952, started at Indianapolis during this period.\nFrom 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations. Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the List of Formula One drivers, Clemente Biondetti is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950, but only one of these counted for the World Championship.\nIn the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 83053, "end_char_idx": 87739, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd5f5fd6-fb9f-4845-a5d0-234f603c6ae1": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd5f5fd6-fb9f-4845-a5d0-234f603c6ae1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7fe67956-087b-41a4-bae8-97c82d68a1e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f34a009cd8923e4cfabd3dbb5cfcfdb0ef30d8af27915cce613d44dd41b63ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== European non-championship racing ===\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in 1950 a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the Race of Champions, Oulton Park International Gold Cup and the International Trophy, were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid. These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.\n\n\n=== South African Formula One championship ===\n\nSouth Africa's domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there were also locally built or modified cars.\n\n\n=== British Formula One Championship ===\n\nThe DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980, the series saw South African Desir\u00e9 Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFormula One video games\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n Media related to Formula One at Wikimedia Commons", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 87742, "end_char_idx": 90228, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e44e0348-4687-4533-abad-f4b174032c48": {"__data__": {"id_": "e44e0348-4687-4533-abad-f4b174032c48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e831c160a128da0093ddc10ee953b9913acc70615d585c0593814e69f10722f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09c75a7e-8c2d-4947-8cc4-3c4be8a6719c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "229feab7a760a8b75b9701ed53bc36abc78de5d31c3895b049b8e91981070e12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A Formula One car or F1 car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel formula racing car used to compete in Formula One racing events. It has substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged engine positioned behind the driver. The cars are constructed of carbon fibre and other composite materials for durability and are built to withstand high impact forces and considerable g forces. \nThe early F1 cars were simpler designs with no wings, front mounted engines, and required significant driver effort to control. Later improvements saw the introduction of lighter cars due to metallurgical advancements, introduction of ground effect cars with the addition of wings and other aerodynamic surfaces, and control electronics. The introduction of turbocharged engines with higher efficiency, and energy recovery system to boost speeds led to faster and efficient racing cars.\nA modern F1 car has a carbon fibre monocoque with an open cockpit consisting of a single driver seat and detachable steering. The 1.6 L V6 engine is capable of producing up to 950 hp (710 kW), which enables the car to reach speeds of up to 375 km/h (233 mph). It uses semi-automatic gear boxes with an eight speed transmission and an electronic-hydraulic control to drive the car. The 18 inch wheels are fitted with slick tyres during normal dry conditions, and are fitted with carbon disc brakes capable of handling temperatures of up to 1,000 \u00b0C (1,830 \u00b0F). The wings act as inverted aerofoils to produce negative lift, resulting in increased down force.\nThe regulations governing the cars are specified by the FIA and have undergone considerable changes since their introduction in the late 1940s. The cars are constructed and operated by the constructors in racing events, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced. Since the 2000s, several changes have been made by the FIA, which are aimed at sustainability and cost reduction, such as the cap on car parts, usage of mixed fuel, and usage of energy recovery systems. It has also sought to reduce the downforce and limit speeds, while simplifying car design and improve close racing. Cars have also been made safer with durable materials, improvement in safety features and addition of halo.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2250, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09c75a7e-8c2d-4947-8cc4-3c4be8a6719c": {"__data__": {"id_": "09c75a7e-8c2d-4947-8cc4-3c4be8a6719c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e831c160a128da0093ddc10ee953b9913acc70615d585c0593814e69f10722f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e44e0348-4687-4533-abad-f4b174032c48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf34583e539541b8d1e2d8b2d8228d37abd1fb305ac89900b8aca698ce7f4090", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8df197a6-fe22-4d2d-8cf1-20ef13432a8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b546b9fdb00f53bc2a74d5fc99ff6efb26b1afda0f49b365316de2a4f66beed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== History ==\n\nThe early F1 cars were simpler designs with no wings, front mounted engines, and required significant driver effort to control. In the early 1960s, lighter cars with aluminum chassis were introduced with the addition of wings towards the end of the same decade. In the 1970s, understanding of aerodynamics began to impact the car designs singnificantly, with the introduction of nose boxes in the front, and air boxes behind the driver to increase air flow to the engine. The advent of ground effect cars in the 1980s, allowed to increase downforce with a small drag penalty. With continuous improvement in engines and the introduction of turbochargers, cars produced an increased amount of thrust. The maximum permitted width of the cars was 2,150 mm (85 in) with a 1,500 mm (59 in) front axle and 1,000 mm (39 in) wide rear axle, and the maximum width was reduced to 2,000 mm (79 in) in 1994. \nFollowing the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, a number of changes were introduced, which led to the development of modern day F1 cars. A 10 mm (0.39 in) thick wooden skid block was added on the underbody to enforce minimum ground clearance. In the following seasons, several modifications were introduced, the underbody plank was lengthened and a 50 mm (2.0 in) tall, 500 mm (20 in) wide block was added on top of the plank to minimize the ground effect. The front wing height was increased from 40 to 50 mm (1.6 to 2.0 in) and the maximum height was reduced to 200 mm (7.9 in) above the reference plane. A step wise design was introduced with reduced side pods, and engine cowling, and exclusion zones were added around the wheels to prevent any bodywork in the area apart from the suspension.\n\nSince the 1990s, improved electronics were incorporated to increase the efficiency, handling and reliability of the cars. Since the 2000s, with computer aided design, teams have been able to produce more efficient cars, with several changes aimed at sustainability and cost reduction, such as the cap on car parts, usage of mixed fuel, and usage of energy recovery systems. In the 2000s, the front height was increased progressively to 150 mm (5.9 in) and the maximum width and height were defined as 500 mm (20 in) and 950 mm (37 in) respectively. FIA enacted further changes to the body structure over the subsequent years such to improve racing changes to the structure and height of the front wing, and changes to floor design. The governing body outlawed several structures introduced by the teams, including double diffusers, modified exhaust ducts, and extra aerodynamic elements such as sharklets, cooling slots, winglets and dive planes. Modifiable front wings were also trialed in 2009 and the Drag reduction system (DRS) was introduced in 2011. The latest rules in the late 2010s introduced simpler front wings, which reduced the dirty air from the cars, and enabled more closer racing. The underside of the vehicle must be flat between the axles with the wear of skid block limited to a maximum of 1 mm (0.039 in) during the race. The latest regulations which came into effect in 2022 with the intention of enabling more closer racing, simplified the aerodynamic components, which reduced vortices, and created more ground effect.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe modern Formula One car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel racing car with substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged engine positioned behind the driver. The monocoque is constructed of reinforced carbon fibre, lined with kevlar and fire resistant materials to protect the drivers from high impact crashes and fires. The driver cockpit consists of single seat with a detachable steering wheel in the front. There is a halo mounted on top of the open cockpit, which was introduced in 2018. Two front and rear wheels are bolted to the suspension and the engine is mounted behind the driver. The front and rear wings are aerodynamic surfaces fitted on the extremes. The minimum weight permissible is 798 kg (1,759 lb) including the driver, while fitted with dry-weather tyres and no fuel. The cars are limited to dimensions of 5.63 m (18.5 ft) in length, 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in width, and 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) in height.\n\n\n== Components ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2253, "end_char_idx": 6481, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8df197a6-fe22-4d2d-8cf1-20ef13432a8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8df197a6-fe22-4d2d-8cf1-20ef13432a8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e831c160a128da0093ddc10ee953b9913acc70615d585c0593814e69f10722f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09c75a7e-8c2d-4947-8cc4-3c4be8a6719c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "229feab7a760a8b75b9701ed53bc36abc78de5d31c3895b049b8e91981070e12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb4a917d-eef7-439f-bd13-f4a04bc65a24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd4cc9b5bfa3c9a42941c05511e095cb6b28f135ec9f51021f07c49ba2a13e17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Components ==\n\n\n=== Engine and fuel ===\n\nSince its inception, Formula One has used a number of different engine regulations. During the early years, a front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout was used with a 4.5 L naturally aspirated or a 1.5 L supercharged engine capable of an output power of up to 317 kW (425 hp). Progressively the engine capacity and power were reduced, and was limited to 0.75 L with compressor or 2.5 L without one during the late 1950s. In 1961, the engine was positioned behind the driver and the capacity was regulated to 1300\u20131500 cc with a power output of 150\u2013225 hp without supercharging. In 1966, FIA increased engine capacity and allowed up to 3.0 L atmospheric with a power range of 290\u2013370 kW (390\u2013500 hp) or 1.5 L supercharged with a power range of 370\u2013670 kW (500\u2013900 hp). While the basic structure and configuration of a Formula One remained same since the late 1960s, the power output of the engines increased progressively to 1,000 kW (1,400 hp) at 12000 rpm in 1986. In 1987-88, turbocharged eight-cylinder engines were introduced alongside atmospheric engines with fuel caps for races introduced for turbocharged engines. Turbocharges were banned from 1989 with 3.0 L engines becoming the norm in the 1990s and led to the introduction of V10 and V12 engines.\n\nThe teams started constructing engine components using advanced metal alloys such as titanium and beryllium, which reduced weight and improved the efficiency and durability. FIA outlawed the use of these towards the late 1990s with only iron and aluminum permitted. The introduction of pneumatic valve springs in the same period allowed the engines to reach up to 20,000 rpm. For a decade, the F1 cars had run with 3.0 L naturally aspirated V10 engines producing 730\u2013750 kW (980\u20131,000 hp) of power with top speeds of up to 375 km/h (233 mph). Though the FIA continually enforced material and design restrictions to limit power, the V10s in the 2005 season were reported to develop 730 kW (980 hp), power levels not seen since the ban on turbocharged engines in 1989. Before the 2006 season, FIA introduced a new engine formula, which mandated cars to be powered by 2.4 liter naturally aspirated V8 engine configuration, with no more than four valves per cylinder and banned variable intake trumpets. For the 2009 season, the engines were limited to 18,000 rpm to improve engine reliability and cut costs. In 2012, the engines consumed around 450 L (16 cu ft) of air per second with a race fuel consumption rate of 75 L/100 km (3.8 mpg\u2011imp; 3.1 mpg\u2011US).\n\nFor the 2014 season, FIA introduced 1.6 L six-cylinder turbocharged engines with a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) to increase fuel-efficiency. For 2022, a modified V6 configuration was introduced with a more powerful KERS. Over the years, FIA has been gradually reducing the overall allocation of engines per season and with the increasing number of races, each engine is expected to last for at least 2,000 km (1,200 mi). FIA had also introduced standardization of certain engine parts and cap on engine components to reduce costs with grid penalties applied for drivers who exceed the allocation. As per the current regulations, a maximum of five power units are allowed per season. The engine is located between the driver and the rear axle and is bolted to the cockpit at the front end, and transmission and rear suspension at the back end.\nThe fuel used in F1 cars is a mixture of unleaded petrol and ethanol with a tightly controlled mixture ratio. As a part of the regulation change in 2022, the ethanol content was increased from 5.75% to 10%. Cars were allowed to be refuelled during the race till 2010, after which refueling was banned. The cars are stipulated to carry a maximum fuel of 110 kg per race, with at least 1 kg to be made available to the FIA for post race inspection. Any abnormalties in the fuel or failure to provide the sample results in disqualification from the race. The fuel bladder is made of high quality rubber lined with kevlar for protection against crashes and is located in front of the engine, behind the cockpit.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6465, "end_char_idx": 10579, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb4a917d-eef7-439f-bd13-f4a04bc65a24": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb4a917d-eef7-439f-bd13-f4a04bc65a24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e831c160a128da0093ddc10ee953b9913acc70615d585c0593814e69f10722f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8df197a6-fe22-4d2d-8cf1-20ef13432a8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b546b9fdb00f53bc2a74d5fc99ff6efb26b1afda0f49b365316de2a4f66beed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d889297-7bdc-4893-9a4d-aaec1c2174fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "673589b1bbbf1b4509e7df991c070c4e1f0afbcc532f791dc60e4775b819bf4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Steering and transmission ===\n\nA typical steering wheel used in a F1 car is an electronic control with an array of knobs, buttons and levers. It is made of carbon fibre with titanium, silicon, fibreglass, and copper parts. It has two driver handles on the sides with a LCD display in the center, LED gear shift lights at the top and gear shift paddles in the back. The steering wheel is used to control various functions of the car such as gears, engine revolutions, fuel\u2013air mix, brake balance, differential mapping, among others. The display displays various data points including engine parameters, gears, temperature and time. The steering wheel is also used to access the radio and control the drinking mechanism. It weighs about 1.3 kg (2.9 lb) and can cost about $50,000. \n\nWhile conventional manual gearboxes were used earlier, modern Formula One cars use semi-automatic sequential gearboxes with a rear-wheel-drive. It has eight forward gears and a reverse gear operated with paddle-shifters. The gearbox is constructed of carbon reinforced titanium, and is bolted onto the back of the engine. Fully-automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control were banned in the 2000s to keep driver skill and involvement important in controlling the car, and reduce costs. When the driver initiates gear shifts using paddles mounted on the back of the steering wheel, a system of solenoids, hydraulic actuators, and sensors perform the actual shift, and electronic throttle control. Clutch control is also performed in the same manner except when launching from neutral into first gear, where the driver operates the clutch manually using a lever on the back of the steering wheel. The clutch is a multi-plate carbon design with a diameter of less than 100 mm (3.9 in), and weight of less than 1 kg (2.2 lb), capable of handling up to 540 kW (720 hp).

In the late 1950s, cotton fabric was replaced with nylon fabric, which reduced weight and increased durability. In the 1960s, the tyres became wider and synthetic rubber was used along with nylon. Slick tyres were introduced for the first time during the 1971 season. In the 1975 season, the cars used 26.0\"\u00d716.2\"\u201313\" slick tyre (diameter \u00d7 width) in the rear on a 13\"\u00d718\" rim, and a 20.0\"\u00d79.2\"\u201313\" slick tyre in the front on a 13\u00d710\" rim. For the 1981 season, the maximum diameter of the rear tyre was limited to 26.0\", and the diameter of the front tyres was increased, with the tyres measuring 25.0\"\u00d710.0\"\u201313\" in the front and 26.0\"\u00d715.0\"\u201313\" in the rear. Ahead of the 1993 season, the width of the rear was reduced from 18\" to 15\". In 1998, grooved tyres were introduced with three groove lines in the front tyres and four groove lines in the rear tyres. Between 1999 and 2008, regulations required the tyres to feature a minimum of four 14 mm (0.55 in) grooves in them, with the intention of slowing the cars down as the slick tyre, with no indentations, provides the most grip in dry conditions. The tyre sizes were limited to 355 mm (14.0 in) at the front and 380 mm (15 in) at the rear, and the maximum diameter was 660 mm (26 in) for dry and 670 mm (26 in) for wet tyres. Briefly in 2005, tyre changes during the race were outlawed and the tyre compounds were made harder to last the full race distance. \n\nSlick tyres were reintroduced at the beginning of 2009, with the front tyres narrowed from 270 mm (11 in) to 245 mm (9.6 in), to shift the balance towards mechanical grip in an attempt to increase overtaking. Since the introduction of slick tyres in 2009, the tyre construct has remained almost the same with only variations to tyre sizes. The teams are given a fixed number of sets of three compounds of slick dry weather tyres, and additional sets of grooved intermediate and wet weather tyres for a race weekend. The tyre compounds are demarcated by a colour coding, with the teams mandated to use at least two dry compounds during a dry race. Briefly in 2016, teams were given an option to choose tyre compounds. For the 2017 F1 season, significantly wider Pirelli tyres were introduced at both the front and rear axles, while the overall diameter of the tyres was increased from 660 to 670 mm (26 to 26 in). Front tyre size increased to 305/670-R13 while rear-tyre size increased to 405/670-R13. For the 2022 F1 season, the wheel rim diameter size was increased from 13 to 18 in (330 to 460 mm), and the diameter was increased from 670 to 720 mm (26 to 28 in).\n\nDisc brakes are used for braking, similar to road cars. The brakes consist of a rotor disc and a caliper, with six piston clamp pads inside each caliper. The driver applies pressure on the brake pedal, which uses hydraulic pressure to drive the clamps and the friction on the disc slows the car. The front brakes are simpler with direct pressure applied onto the breaking discs to slow down. In the rear, braking is achieved by the combination of three forces, friction on the brakes, resistance from the engine, and the energy recovery system. The driver can control the effect of these and brake distribution using the steering wheel. \nAn average F1 car can decelerate from 100 to 0 km/h (62 to 0 mph) in less than 15 m (49 ft) and hence the brakes are subjected to high temperatures of up to 1,000 \u00b0C (1,830 \u00b0F) and severe g forces. To withstand high temperatures, brakes are made of carbon composites. The brakes are cooled by air passing through numerous small holes in the brake ducts.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12686, "end_char_idx": 16401, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17d25f3a-ffeb-46e4-a21b-f095a9da85dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "17d25f3a-ffeb-46e4-a21b-f095a9da85dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e831c160a128da0093ddc10ee953b9913acc70615d585c0593814e69f10722f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d889297-7bdc-4893-9a4d-aaec1c2174fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "673589b1bbbf1b4509e7df991c070c4e1f0afbcc532f791dc60e4775b819bf4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c1b4d24-41ce-4268-b350-743d2a9639ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d212246737c9fcec6e877a057de3e003acfbe7aacdfe7a838e1607a9ea7ac576", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Wings ===\n\nEarly designs linked wings directly to the suspension, but several accidents led to rules stating that wings must be fixed rigidly to the chassis.

The front wing is a forked structure with a maximum width of 1,800 mm (71 in) and must not extend more than 200 mm (7.9 in) beyond the center line. It can have a maximum of four wing elements and should not bend more than 5 mm (0.20 in). It is made of aluminium alloy, carbon fibre and fibre glass, and can cost up to $300,000. The rear wing consists of a main plane which spans the width of the car with smaller horizontal flaps that angle downwards.

Electrical systems use a motor-generator incorporated in the car's transmission which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Once the energy has been harnessed, it is stored in a battery and released at will. Mechanical systems capture braking energy and use it to turn a small flywheel which can spin at high speeds.

It is made of high strength composite materials and is subjected to various load tests by the FIA to ensure its rigidity. The halo is a safety device mounted on the cockpit, and is made of series of curved metal bars intended to protect the driver's head during crashes. The air box is situated behind the cockpit, and serves as the receptacle of the high speed air moving over the body. It supplies the pressurized air to the engine intakes, boosting its power and absorbs the turbulence generated from the air passing over the driver's helmet. Air filters are used to filter the dirty air before being passed into the engines.\n\n\n== Aerodynamics ==\nAerodynamics has become key to success in the sport, and the teams spend time and money on research and development of the same each year. The sculpted front and rear wings with the rest of the body parts such as the vanes beneath the nose, bargeboards, sidepods, underbody, and the rear diffuser, play a role in determining the aerodynamic efficiency of the car. A modern Formula One car capable of developing up to six G of lateral cornering force and a downforce equivalent to twice its weight at 190 km/h (120 mph). The car is designed to create the maximum amount of downforce for the minimal amount of drag with the configuration often modified to the  requirements of a particular track. The interaction of various components amplify the total downforce more than the sum of their standalone contributions.\n\nThe wings operate similarly to inverted airplane wings, to produce a negative lift or downward force. The profile of the front wing, along with the angle of attack against the incoming air, define the downforce generated. Other smaller elements such as flaps, and gaps between the elements help with controlling the airflow. A steeper angle of attack increases the downforce while creating increased drag. The front wing also directs the airflow to the rest of the car with the air flowing into the sidepod intakes used for the temperature regulation of the engine. The air flowing underneath the floor helps to seal the gap with the ground, contributing to the ground effect. A low-pressure area is created which effectively sucks the car towards the ground, increasing the down force and grip of the car. The designers aspire for a smoother airflow over the body of the car, while minimizing the wakes formed by the rotating wheels.Vortices created between the front wing and the nose box help to reduce the turbulence. Minor changes to the front wing can have drastic effects on the aerodynamics of the car.\n\nThe rear wings serve similarly to the front wings as inverted airfoils, and deflect the air downwards, causing a down force. The angle of the main plane and flaps determine the direction of the airflow, with other elements used to further fine tune the same. Higher angles increase downforce while also contributing to a higher turbulence and decreased stability of the rear wing. The rear wings are designed so as to withstand high loads without decreasing the downforce. The other structural elements of the car such as the side pods, and body work determine the amount of air flowing through the rear wings. The rear wing generates vortexes which keep the airflow attached to the car longer, delaying the aerodynamic stall. The rear wing can be modified to various configurations depending on the race track and the circumstances. The DRS opens a slot in the rear wing at the behest of the driver. It reduces drag and increases power, and hence speed, and is allowed to be operated in specific instances. The diffuser located at the rear is used to combine the pressurized airflow from the underside of the car to create more downforce.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18213, "end_char_idx": 22132, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc22063b-88d9-44e9-bd52-55477a103a83": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc22063b-88d9-44e9-bd52-55477a103a83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645083", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e831c160a128da0093ddc10ee953b9913acc70615d585c0593814e69f10722f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c1b4d24-41ce-4268-b350-743d2a9639ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d212246737c9fcec6e877a057de3e003acfbe7aacdfe7a838e1607a9ea7ac576", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Performance ==\n\nThe 1.6 L V6 engine on a modern F1 car churn out 710 kW (950 bhp) at 15,000 rpm. This enables a modern F1 car to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 1.8 seconds, and from 0 to 100 mph (0 to 161 km/h) in 2.6 seconds. It has a power-to-weight ratio of 1,297 hp/t, which would theoretically allow the car to reach 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than a second. However, due to traction loss, it accelerates slower and when the traction loss is minimal at higher speeds, the car accelerates at a very high rate. A F1 car is also capable of rapid deceleration and cornering at high speeds. Due to rapid acceleration and deceleration, the drivers may experience high levels of g force. The drivers experience 3\u20134 g during acceleration, and 5\u20136 g when braking from high speeds. During cornering at high speeds, drivers experience lateral forces between 4\u20136.5 g.\nA modern F1 car can achieve top speeds of nearly 375 km/h (233 mph), and operate on average speeds of about 200 km/h (120 mph) during a race. Top speeds in practice are achieved in straight parts of a track, and is determined by the aerodynamic configuration of the car in balancing between high straight-line speed (low aerodynamic drag) and high cornering speed (high downforce) to achieve the fastest lap time. In 2005, Mclaren recorded a record top speed of 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph) during testing, which was officially recognised by the FIA as the fastest speed ever achieved by an F1 car.  At the 2016 Mexican Grand Prix, the Williams of Valtteri Bottas reached a top speed of 372.54 km/h (231.49 mph) in racing conditions. Away from the track, the BAR Honda team used a modified BAR 007 car, to set an unofficial speed record of 413 km/h (257 mph) on a one way straight-line run on 6 November 2005 at Bonneville Speedway and the car set an FIA ratified record of 400 km/h (250 mph) on 21 July 2006 Bonneville.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial F1 site\nF1 Technical\nAnimated F1 Car Guide\nOfficial F1 site \u2013 Technical analysis\nRacecar Engineering Cars\nRacecar Engineering Engines", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22135, "end_char_idx": 24213, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96c6c58c-91ce-4857-b84a-af98026ca3b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "96c6c58c-91ce-4857-b84a-af98026ca3b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6aeec2df-0383-430c-8ee5-fb278db877f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8333ec443839f21b49c51b517434a7cb3ebcbd41f0ccf18a25954d25de02bb8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This article gives an outline of Formula One engines, also called Formula One power units since the hybrid era starting in 2014. Since its inception in 1947, Formula One has used a variety of engine regulations. Formulae limiting engine capacity had been used in Grand Prix racing on a regular basis since after World War I. The engine formulae are divided according to era.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nFormula One currently uses 1.6 litre four-stroke turbocharged 90 degree V6 double-overhead camshaft (DOHC) reciprocating engines. They were introduced in 2014 and have been developed over the subsequent seasons. Mostly from the 2023 season, specifications on Formula One engines, including the software used to control them and the maximum per-engine price to F1 teams of \u20ac15,000,000, have been frozen until the end of 2025, when the completely new 2026 spec will come into effect.\n\n\n=== High revolutions ===\nThe history of F1 engines has always been a quest for more power, and the enormous power a Formula One engine produces had been generated by operating at a very high rotational speed, reaching over 20,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) during the 2004\u20132005 seasons.  This is because an engine, theoretically, produces double the power when operated twice as fast if combustion (thermal) efficiency and energy loss remain the same. High-revving engines won races no matter how much fuel it consumed and how much wasted heat it generated, as long as they produced more power over the competition. However, with the skyrocketing cost of exotic materials and production methods enabling the high-speed operation, and the realisation that such advancements in technology would likely never applied to production vehicles (because the resultant product is very inefficient), it was decided to limit the maximum rotational speed (rev) to 19,000 rpm in 2007.  The maximum rev was further limited to 18,000 rpm in 2009, and to 15,000 rpm for the 2014\u20132021 seasons.\nStill, the high speed operation of F1 engines contrasts with road car engines of a similar size, which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm.\n\n\n=== Long conrods ===\nThe high-speed rotation created a vibration problem caused by secondary imbalance inherent in piston engines.  Tony Rudd found in BRM 1.5L P56 V8 engine (11,000rpm redline) of 1961-1962 that a long conrod, much longer than required, was key to reducing the secondary vibration, enabling a high revolution.  Coventry Climax FWMV Mk.III, using a much longer conrod in the same cylinder block as Mk.II, proved this concept in 1963.  Other teams gradually found this secret, but this concept was not used in mass-produced cars for a long time until Daihatsu applied it to the extremely long-stroke 1.5L 3SZ-VE engine introduced with desaxe crankshaft, 4-valves, and variable valve timing in October 2005.\n\n Notes:\n\n\n=== Valve springs ===\nUntil the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal springs used to close the valves. The speed required to close the valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power required to drive the camshaft to open the valves, to the point where the loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault in 1986, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have an extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers have used pneumatic valve springs with pressurised air.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3686, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aeec2df-0383-430c-8ee5-fb278db877f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aeec2df-0383-430c-8ee5-fb278db877f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "96c6c58c-91ce-4857-b84a-af98026ca3b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30bcf96a82d804bf2b88998b69ab2f9aaf0909e75c42451f0ad01b2e45123b96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1da2a233-376d-4005-b244-fed7d2e8b857", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f8eb711a56cf87b46f7646c0d059b9dd37c3d56602c7d28b7b9cd6865d88114", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Valve springs ===\nUntil the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal springs used to close the valves.

Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers have used pneumatic valve springs with pressurised air.\n\n\n=== Piston speed ===\nIn addition to the use of pneumatic valve springs, a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design, allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds. Improved design also allows narrower connecting rod ends and so narrower main bearings. This permits higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a virtual stop to almost twice the mean speed (approximately 40 m/s), then back to zero. This occurs once for each of the four strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center (TDC) and is in the region of 95,000 m/s2, about 9,700 times standard gravity (9,700 G).\nTo lower the maximum piston/conrod acceleration, Formula One cars use short-stroke, multi-cylinder engines that result in lower average piston speed for a given displacement. After seeing some 16 cylinder engines, the number of cylinders was limited to twelve in 1989, ten in 2000, eight in 2006 and six in 2014. These regulation changes made higher-speed designs more difficult and less efficient. To operate at high engine speeds under such limits, the stroke must be short to prevent catastrophic failure, usually from the connecting rod, which is under very large stresses. Having a short stroke means a relatively large bore is required to reach a given displacement. This results in less efficient combustion, due mostly to flame-front propagation having to travel the long distance (for a volume) of ever thinner disk (larger diameter with less height) -shaped combustion chamber deviating far away from the ideal sphere shape with the tip of spark plug at its center.\n\n Notes:\n\n\n=== Efficiency ===\nDue to the higher speed operation and the tighter restriction on the number of cylinders, efficiency of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine did not improve much since the 1967 Ford Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure stayed at around 14 bar (1.4 MPa) for a long time.\nFrom the 2014 season, a new concept of limiting the maximum fuel flow rate was introduced, which limits the power if energy loss and air/fuel ratio are constant.  While the bore and stroke figures are now fixed by the rules, this regulation promoted the competition to improve powertrain efficiency.  As energy loss increases nearly exponentially with engine speed, the rev limit became meaningless, so it was lifted in 2022.  Currently, F1 engines rev up to about 13,000rpm, while the combustion efficiency has risen to about 40 bar BMEP and beyond, using lean and rapid burn techniques enabling \u03bb>1 (average air/fuel ratio much leaner than 14.7:1 by mass) and very high mechanical and effective compression ratios.\nIn addition, energy recovery systems from exhaust pressure (MGU-Heat) and engine brake (MGU-Kinetic) are allowed to further improve efficiency.  MGU-H is an electric motor/generator on the common shaft between the exhaust turbine and intake compressor of the turbocharger, while MGU-K is also an electric motor/generator driven by (or driving) crankshaft at a fixed ratio.\nTogether with improvements in fuel and these energy recovery systems, F1 engines increased power using the same amount of fuel in recent years.  For example, Honda RA621H engine of 2021 season generated over 100 kW (130 bhp) more maximum power over RA615H of the 2015 season at the same 100 kg/h fuel flow rate.\nWith the hugely improved efficiency of the combustion, mechanicals, software and turbocharger, F1 engines are generating much less heat and noise compared to the levels in 2014, and Stefano Domenicali said the 2026 regulation will impose intentionally louder exhaust sound to please the fans.\n\n Notes:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2842, "end_char_idx": 7540, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1da2a233-376d-4005-b244-fed7d2e8b857": {"__data__": {"id_": "1da2a233-376d-4005-b244-fed7d2e8b857", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6aeec2df-0383-430c-8ee5-fb278db877f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8333ec443839f21b49c51b517434a7cb3ebcbd41f0ccf18a25954d25de02bb8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "142fd7e7-e6b5-4587-ba2c-ebd031b97d7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5423da23c12fef903c577169c912a35bdd4d697e57a7e18b4f9c9f5bc528b0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== History ==\nFormula One engines have come through various regulations, manufacturers, and configurations. Throughout its history, Formula One has been the forefront for technological innovation in engine design. From the early naturally aspirated engines to the introduction of turbocharged units and hybrid powertrains, each era has pushed the boundaries of engineering. The shift towards hybrids and sustainable technologies reflects the sport's commitment to environmental responsibility and technological advancement. It is imperative to understand the distinction among the terms \"Grand Prix\", \"World Championship\" and \"Formula One\" to come to grips with the history.\nCar racing in various forms began almost immediately after the invention of the automobile, and many of the first organised car racing events were held in Europe before 1900. There had been the tradition of calling a particular race in an event with the name of the award given to the winner in France and some other countries, as traditional racing events often had multiple races and classes, like Men, Women, 100m, 1500m, breast-stroke, etc.  In the case of the car race held in Pau, France in 1900, there were no class divisions, and no prize on record was given to the winner, Ren\u00e9 de Knyff driving a Panhard et Revassor (2.1L, 4 cylinder engine called the 'Phoenix' jointly developed with Gottlieb Daimler in Germany, about 20 hp), who became the commissioner of the CSI later.  In 1901, the event was named \"Semaine de Pau (Week in Pau)\" held at Circuit du Sud-Ouest, and the prizes awarded to the winners were \"Grand Prix de Pau (Grand Prize of Pau)\" for the \"650 kg or heavier\" class, \"Grand Prix du Palais d'Hiver (Grand Prize of the Winter Palace)\" for \"400 \u2013 650 kg\" class, and \"Second Grand Prix du Palais d'Hiver\" for the \"under 400 kg\" class.  This event is significant not only because it called the prizes Grand Prix, but also because it was one of the very first automobile race events, including the fastest class of cars, held on a closed circuit (the 1900 race was on an open road).\n\nDuring and after World War I (1914\u20131918), it became obvious that the size of engines (and if they were supercharged), not the size and weight of cars, primarily determined how fast they could run. Also, wealthy people started enjoying racing the smaller and more evenly matched Voiturette cars more than the no-limits \"Voiture\" 5-11L (mostly 4-cylinder) behemoths that contested the fastest class. In 1926, then-current Voiturette regulation of \"up to 1,500 cc, supercharged\" was adopted to the formerly unlimited Voiture class of Grand Prix races in France, and Voiturette class was re-defined as \"up to 1,100 cc, no supercharger\".\nFormula One was born as the first internationally unified regulation to define a class of racing cars in 1946 to be effective 1947.  It was defined by Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI), the sporting branch of F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), reflecting the Voiture regulation of \"up to 1,500 cc supercharged, or 4,500 cc without supercharger\".  After Formula One was more or less 'ratified' or accepted by other countries, Formula Two was defined in 1947 as \"up to 500 cc supercharged, or 2,000 cc without\".\nIn contrast to the pre-existed European Drivers' Championship, Formula One events were meant to be competition among the countries. Each car, or team, represented a country in this 'international' race, with the cars painted in the \"national colours\", like red for Italy, green for the UK, silver for Germany, and blue for France. The World Championship for Drivers was defined by the CSI in 1949 for 1950 and onwards to honour the drivers, instead of the countries they represented. The World Championship for Constructors started in 1958, created partly to resolve the then-common dispute between a winning driver and his team on the ownership of the Grand Prix trophy. These championships had a longer-term effect of downplaying the country representation. \nOver the years, Formula One added more and more regulations, not only on engines but chassis, tyres, fuel, inspections, championship points, penalties, safety measures, cost control, licensing, distribution of profits, how the qualifying and races must be governed and run, etc., etc.  Today, the vast regulations on Power Unit are a very small part of what defines Formula One, which regulates even the number of Summer vacation days the constructor factories must observe.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7543, "end_char_idx": 12022, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "142fd7e7-e6b5-4587-ba2c-ebd031b97d7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "142fd7e7-e6b5-4587-ba2c-ebd031b97d7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1da2a233-376d-4005-b244-fed7d2e8b857", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f8eb711a56cf87b46f7646c0d059b9dd37c3d56602c7d28b7b9cd6865d88114", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7f9388c-6924-4359-9117-15467e1fdeeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8a711eba0fdef604e0033070cda6e81793dda4bae885f87534d401c4ae69acf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== 1947\u20131953 ===\nThis era used pre-war voiturette engine regulations, with 4.5 L atmospheric and 1.5 L supercharged engines.

Although a few manufacturers had been aiming for larger engines, the transition was not smooth and 1966 was a transitional year, with 2.0 L versions of the BRM and Coventry-Climax V8 engines being used by several entrants. The appearance of the standard-produced Cosworth DFV in 1967 made it possible for small manufacturers to join the series with a chassis designed in-house. Compression devices were allowed for the first time since 1960, but it was not until 1977 that a company actually had the finance and interest of building one, when Renault debuted their new Gordini V6 turbocharged engine at that year's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. This engine had a considerable power advantage over the naturally aspirated Cosworth DFV, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo engines.\nBy the start of the 1980s, Renault had proved that turbocharging was the way to go in order to stay competitive in Formula One, particularly at high-altitude circuits like Kyalami in South Africa and Interlagos in Brazil. Ferrari introduced their all-new V6 turbocharged engine in 1981, before Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone managed to persuade BMW to manufacture straight-4 turbos for his team from 1982 onwards. In 1983, Alfa Romeo introduced a V8 turbo, and by the end of that year Honda and Porsche had introduced their own V6 turbos (the latter badged as TAG in deference to the company that provided the funding). Cosworth and the Italian Motori Moderni concern also manufactured V6 turbos during the 1980s, while Hart Racing Engines manufactured their own straight-4 turbo.\nBy mid-1985, every Formula One car was running with a turbocharged engine. In 1986, power figures were reaching unprecedented levels, with all engines reaching over 1,000 hp (750 kW) during qualifying with unrestricted turbo boost pressures. This was especially seen with the BMW straight-4 turbo, the M12/13, which produced around 1,400\u20131,500 hp (1,040\u20131,120 kW) at 5.5 bar of boost in qualifying trim, but was detuned to produce between 850\u2013900 hp (630\u2013670 kW) in race spec. However, these engines and gearboxes were very unreliable because of the engine's immense power, and would only last about four laps. For the race, the turbocharger's boost was restricted to ensure engine reliability; but the engines still produced 850\u20131,000 hp (630\u2013750 kW) during the race.\nThe power range from 1966 to 1986 was between 285 hp (210 kW) to 500 hp (370 kW), turbos 500 hp (370 kW) to 900 hp (670 kW) in race trim, and in qualifying, up to 1,400 hp (1,040 kW). Following their experiences at Indianapolis, in 1971 Lotus made a few unsuccessful experiments with a Pratt & Whitney turbine fitted to chassis which also had four-wheel-drive.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12990, "end_char_idx": 16578, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e327139b-3795-46e4-82b4-3e2321829001": {"__data__": {"id_": "e327139b-3795-46e4-82b4-3e2321829001", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7f9388c-6924-4359-9117-15467e1fdeeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8a711eba0fdef604e0033070cda6e81793dda4bae885f87534d401c4ae69acf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9116acdf-0801-465f-a75c-c55f97d63f08", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0961cb82368d15d5bc57be6c5fcce1f64d91c53ec73f5f3974ecbd0bc8052ad1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== 1987\u20131988 ===\nFollowing the turbo domination, forced induction was allowed for two seasons before its eventual ban in 1989. The FIA regulations limited boost pressure, to 4 bar in qualifying in 1987 for 1.5 L turbo; and allowed a larger 3.5 L formula. Fuel tank sizes were further reduced in size to 150 litres for turbo cars to limit the amount of boost used in a race. These seasons were still dominated by turbocharged engines, the Honda RA167E V6 supplying Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Formula One season on a Williams also winning the constructors championship, followed by TAG-Porsche P01 V6 in McLaren then Honda again with the previous RA166E for Lotus then Ferrari's own 033D V6.\n\nThe rest of the grid was powered by the Ford GBA V6 turbo in Benetton, with the only naturally aspirated engine, the DFV-derived Ford-Cosworth DFZ 3.5 L V8 outputting 575 hp (429 kW) in Tyrrell, Lola, AGS, March and Coloni. The massively powerful BMW M12/13 inline-four found in the Brabham BT55 tilted almost horizontally, and in upright position under the Megatron brand in Arrows and Ligier, producing 900 bhp (670 kW) at 3.8 bar in race trim, and an incredible 1,400\u20131,500 bhp (1,040\u20131,120 kW) at 5.5 bar of boost in qualifying spec. Zakspeed was building its own turbo inline-four, Alfa Romeo was to power the Ligiers with an inline-four but the deal fell through after initial testing had been carried out. Alfa was still represented by its old 890T V8 used by Osella, and Minardi was powered by a Motori Moderni V6.\nIn 1988, six teams \u2013 McLaren, Ferrari, Lotus, Arrows, Osella and Zakspeed \u2013 continued with turbocharged engines, now limited to 2.5 bar. Honda's V6 turbo, the RA168E, which produced 685 hp (511 kW) at 12,300 rpm in qualifying, powered the McLaren MP4/4 with which Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost won fifteen of the sixteen races between them. The Italian Grand Prix was won by Gerhard Berger in the Ferrari F1/87/88C, powered by the team's own V6 turbo, the 033E, with about 720 hp (537 kW) at 12,000 rpm in qualifying and 620 hp (462 kW) at 12,000 rpm in races. The Honda turbo also powered Lotus's 100T, while Arrows continued with the Megatron-badged BMW turbo, Osella continued with the Alfa Romeo V8 (now badged as an Osella) and Zakspeed continued with their own straight-4 turbo. All the other teams used naturally aspirated 3.5 L V8 engines: Benetton used the Cosworth DFR, which produced 585 hp (436 kW) at 11,000 rpm; Williams, March and Ligier used the Judd CV, producing 600 hp (447 kW); and the rest of the grid used the previous year's 575 hp (429 kW) Cosworth DFZ.\n\n\n=== 1989\u20131994 ===\n\nTurbochargers were banned from the 1989 Formula One season, leaving only a naturally aspirated 3.5 L formula.

The engine's design was largely influenced by major regulation changes imposed by the FIA after the dreadful events during the year before: the V12 engine was reduced from 3.5 to 3.0 litres. The 3.0-litre engine produced around 700 hp (522 kW) 17,000 rpm in race trim; but was reportedly capable of producing up to 760 hp (567 kW) in its highest state of tune for qualification mode. Between 1995 and 2000, cars using this 3.0 L engine formula, imposed by the FIA, produced a constant power range (depending on engine type and tuning), varying between 600 hp and 815 hp. Most Formula One cars during the 1997 season comfortably produced a consistent power output of between 665\u2013760 hp (495.9\u2013566.7 kW), depending on whether a V8 or V10 engine configuration was used. From 1998 to 2000 it was Mercedes' power that ruled, giving Mika H\u00e4kkinen two world championships. The 1999 McLaren MP4/14 produced between 785 and 810 hp @ 17,000 rpm. Ferrari gradually improved their engine. In 1996, they changed from their traditional V12 engine to a smaller and lighter V10 engine. They preferred reliability to power, losing out to Mercedes in terms of outright power initially. Ferrari's first V10 engine, in 1996, produced 715 hp (533 kW) @ 15,550 rpm, down on power from their most powerful 3.5 L V12 (in 1994), which produced over 830 hp (619 kW) @ 15,800 rpm, but up on power from their last 3.0 L V12 (in 1995), which produced 700 hp (522 kW) @ 17,000 rpm. At the 1998 Japanese GP, Ferrari's 047D engine spec was said to produce over 800 bhp (600 kW), and from 2000 onward, they were never short of power or reliability. To keep costs down, the 3.0 L V10 engine configuration was made fully mandatory for all teams in 2000 so that engine builders would not develop and experiment with other configurations.

Unfortunately, reliability was a large issue with several blowups during the season.\nThe BMW P82, the engine used by the BMW WilliamsF1 Team in 2002, had hit a peak speed of 19,050 rpm in its final evolutionary stage. It was also the first engine in the 3.0 litre V10-era to break through the 19,000 rpm wall, during the 2002 Italian Grand Prix's qualifying. BMW's P83 engine used in 2003 season managed an impressive 19,200 rpm and cleared the 900 bhp (670 kW) mark, at around 940 bhp, and weighs less than 200 lb (91 kg). Honda's RA003E V10 also cleared the 900 bhp (670 kW) mark at the 2003 Canadian Grand Prix.\nIn 2005, no more than 5 valves per cylinder were permitted. Also, the FIA introduced new regulations limiting each car to one engine per two Grand Prix weekends, putting the emphasis on increased reliability. In spite of this, power outputs continued to rise. Mercedes engines had about 930 bhp (690 kW) in this season. Cosworth, Mercedes, Renault, and Ferrari engines all produced around 900 bhp (670 kW) to 940 bhp (700 kW) @ 19,000 rpm. Honda had over 965 bhp (720 kW). The BMW engine made over 950 bhp (710 kW). Toyota engines had over 1,000 bhp (750 kW), according to Toyota Motorsport's executive Vice President, Yoshiaki Kinoshita. However, for reliability and longevity purposes, this power figure may have been detuned to around 960 bhp (720 kW) for races.\n\n\n=== 2006\u20132013 ===\n\nFor 2006, the engines had to be 90\u00b0 V8 of 2.4 litres maximum capacity with a circular bore of 98 mm (3.9 in) maximum, which implies a 39.75 mm (1.565 in) stroke at maximum bore. The engines must have two inlet and two exhaust valves per cylinder, be naturally aspirated and have a 95 kg (209 lb) minimum weight. The previous year's engines with a rev-limiter were permitted for 2006 and 2007 for teams who were unable to acquire a V8 engine, with Scuderia Toro Rosso using a Cosworth V10, after Red Bull's takeover of the former Minardi team did not include the new engines. The 2006 season saw the highest rev limits in the history of Formula One, at well over 20,000 rpm; before a 19,000 rpm mandatory rev limiter was implemented for all competitors in 2007. Cosworth was able to achieve just over 20,000 rpm with their V8, and Renault around 20,500 rpm. Honda did the same; albeit only on the dynamometer.\nPre-cooling air before it enters the cylinders, injection of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block had to be made of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy, and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.\n\nThe reduction in capacity was designed to give a power reduction of around 20% from the three-litre engines, to reduce the increasing speeds of Formula One cars.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25267, "end_char_idx": 29331, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a684a3d9-c329-4e8d-991d-b5fac6dcbcfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a684a3d9-c329-4e8d-991d-b5fac6dcbcfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6853f645-8dda-4d11-b57b-4795ea3e80b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54a841d111bbadf8e4ca02cad9573dada08a4f358f89ea50c0529d14e13ca47c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "59396750-a4c6-4f84-8d50-6e134d7e3e10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "940a3881eff1eecabd807c3f4ddcd78334c693aa3600c1d6410e5978fc7a2f41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Honda did the same; albeit only on the dynamometer.\nPre-cooling air before it enters the cylinders, injection of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden.

The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy, and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.\n\nThe reduction in capacity was designed to give a power reduction of around 20% from the three-litre engines, to reduce the increasing speeds of Formula One cars. Despite this, in many cases the performance of the car improved.  In 2006 Toyota F1 announced an approximate 740 hp (552 kW) output at 18,000 rpm for its new RVX-06 engine, but real figures are of course difficult to obtain. Most cars from this period (2006\u20132008) produced a regular power output of approximately between 720 and 800 hp @ 19,000 rpm (over 20,000 rpm for the 2006 season).\nThe engine specification was frozen in 2007 to keep development costs down. The engines which were used in the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix were used for the 2007 and 2008 seasons and they were limited to 19,000 rpm. In 2009 the limit was reduced to 18,000 rpm with each driver allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines over the season. Any driver needing an additional engine is penalised 10 places on the starting grid for the first race the engine is used. This increases the importance of reliability, although the effect is only seen towards the end of the season. Certain design changes intended to improve engine reliability may be carried out with permission from the FIA. This has led to some engine manufacturers, notably Ferrari and Mercedes, exploiting this ability by making design changes which not only improve reliability but also boost engine power output as a side effect. As the Mercedes engine was proven to be the strongest, re-equalisations of engines were allowed by the FIA to allow other manufacturers to match the power.\n2009 saw the exit of Honda from Formula One. The team was acquired by Ross Brawn, creating Brawn GP and the BGP 001.  With the absence of the Honda engine, Brawn GP retrofitted the Mercedes engine to the BGP 001 chassis. The newly branded team won both the Constructors' Championship and the Drivers' Championship from better-known and better-established contenders Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, and Renault.\nCosworth, absent since the end of the 2006 season, returned in 2010. New teams Lotus Racing, HRT, and Virgin Racing, along with the established Williams, used this engine. The season also saw the withdrawal of the BMW and Toyota engines, as the car companies withdrew from Formula One due to the Great Recession.\nIn 2009, constructors were allowed to use kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS), also called regenerative brakes. Energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor), with a maximum power of 81 hp (60 kW; 82 PS) deployed by an electric motor, for a little over 6 seconds per lap. Four teams used it at some point in the season: Ferrari, Renault, BMW, and McLaren.\nAlthough KERS was still legal in F1 in the 2010 season, all the teams agreed not to use it. KERS returned for the 2011 season, when only three teams elected not to use it. For the 2012 season, only Marussia and HRT raced without KERS, and in 2013 all teams on the grid had KERS. From 2010 to 2013 cars have a regular power of 700\u2013800 hp, averaging around 750 hp @ 18,000 rpm.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 28421, "end_char_idx": 32294, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59396750-a4c6-4f84-8d50-6e134d7e3e10": {"__data__": {"id_": "59396750-a4c6-4f84-8d50-6e134d7e3e10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a684a3d9-c329-4e8d-991d-b5fac6dcbcfb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28714f07d1816c01dff534a2fe7c822681af25b4c813187b0ad8bdf246da975c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b47800bc-aac6-40f8-8027-135fa28d4d86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9aa602f9c080312b90b102b51565c2ac2adf61e5c37dbc1516d2d0818a335073", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor), with a maximum power of 81 hp (60 kW; 82 PS) deployed by an electric motor, for a little over 6 seconds per lap.

The new regulations allow kinetic and heat energy recovery systems. Forced induction was now allowed \u2013 either turbochargers, which last appeared in 1988, or superchargers \u2013 with all constructors opting to use a turbocharger. Instead of limiting the boost level, the regulations introduced a fuel flow restriction at 100 kg of petrol per hour maximum. The engines sounded very different from the previous formula, due to the lower rev limit (15,000 rpm) and the turbocharger. The introduction of these systems in 2014 significantly altered race strategies and team budgets. Energy recovery and deployment strategies became critical factors in race outcomes. On top of that the complexity and cost of developing these hybrid systems led to substantial increases in team spending. This financial strain contributed to the FIA's decision to implement a cost cap starting in the 2021 season, aiming to ensure a more level playing field among teams.\nThe new formula for turbocharged engines have their efficiency improved through turbo-compounding by recovering energy from exhaust gases. The original proposal for four-cylinder turbocharged engines was not welcomed by the racing teams, in particular Ferrari. Adrian Newey stated during the 2011 European Grand Prix that the change to a V6 enables teams to carry the engine as a stressed member, whereas an inline-4 would have required a space frame. A compromise was reached, allowing V6 forced induction engines instead. The engines rarely exceed 12,000 rpm during qualifying and race, due to the new fuel flow restrictions.\nEnergy recovery systems such as KERS had a boost of 160 hp (120 kW) and 2 megajoules per lap. KERS was renamed Motor Generator Unit\u2013Kinetic (MGU-K). Heat energy recovery systems were also allowed, under the name Motor Generator Unit\u2013Heat (MGU-H).\nThe 2015 season was an improvement on 2014, adding about 30\u201350 hp (20\u201340 kW) to most engines, the Mercedes engine being the most powerful with 870 hp (649 kW). In 2019, Renault's engine was claimed to have hit 1,000 hp in qualifying trim.\nOf the previous manufacturers, only Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault produced engines to the new formula in 2014, whereas Cosworth stopped supplying engines. Honda returned as an engine manufacturer in 2015, with McLaren switching to Honda power after using the Mercedes engine in 2014.\nIn January 2018, the FIA issued a technical directive to prevent engine manufacturers from supplying customer teams with unequal engines, ensuring engine performance parity with works teams.\nIn 2019, Red Bull switched from using a Renault engine to Honda power. Honda supplied both Red Bull and AlphaTauri. Honda withdrew as a power unit supplier at the end of 2021, with Red Bull taking over the project and producing the engine in-house.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 31593, "end_char_idx": 35236, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b47800bc-aac6-40f8-8027-135fa28d4d86": {"__data__": {"id_": "b47800bc-aac6-40f8-8027-135fa28d4d86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "59396750-a4c6-4f84-8d50-6e134d7e3e10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "940a3881eff1eecabd807c3f4ddcd78334c693aa3600c1d6410e5978fc7a2f41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cec1bff4-cf72-4692-be3b-505891139ec4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1a713eb980b912010268893279a6224dbd8fdbecfba037307001e5156598d19e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== 2022\u20132025 ===\nIn 2017, the FIA began negotiations with existing constructors and potential new manufacturers over the next generation of engines with a projected introduction date of 2021 but delayed to 2022 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial proposal was designed to simplify engine designs, cut costs, promote new entries and address criticisms directed at the 2014 generation of engines. It called for the 1.6 L V6 configuration to be retained, but abandoned the complex Motor Generator Unit\u2013Heat (MGU-H) system. The Motor Generator Unit\u2013Kinetic (MGU-K) would be more powerful, with a greater emphasis on driver deployment and a more flexible introduction to allow for tactical use. The proposal also called for the introduction of standardised components and design parameters to make components produced by all manufacturers compatible with one another in a system dubbed \"plug in and play\". A further proposal to allow four-wheel drive cars was also made, with the front axle driven by an MGU-K unit\u2014as opposed to the traditional driveshaft\u2014that functioned independently of the MGU-K providing power to the rear axle, mirroring the system developed by Porsche for the 919 Hybrid race car.\nHowever, mostly due to no new engine supplier applying for F1 entry in 2021 and 2022, the abolishment of MGU-H, a more powerful MGU-K and a four-wheel drive system were all shelved with the possibility of their re-introduction for 2026. Instead, the teams and FIA agreed to a radical change in body/chassis aerodynamics to promote more battles on the course at closer distances to each other. They further agreed to an increase in alcohol content from 5.75% to 10% of fuel, and to implement a freeze on power unit design for 2022\u20132025, with the internal combustion engine (ICE), turbocharger and MGU-H being frozen on 1 March and the energy store, MGU-K and control electronics being frozen on 1 September during the 2022 season. Honda, the outgoing engine supplier in 2021, was keen to keep the MGU-H, and Red Bull, who took over the engine production project, backed that opinion. The 4WD system was planned to be based on Porsche 919 Hybrid system, but Porsche ended up not becoming an F1 engine supplier for 2021\u20132022.\n\n\n=== 2026 onwards ===\nNew engine regulations will be introduced from the 2026 season. These engine regulations will see the turbocharged 1.6 V6 internal combustion engine configuration used since 2014 retained. The new power units will produce over 1,000 bhp (750 kW), although the power will come from different places. The MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit \u2013 Heat) will be banned, while the MGU-K's (Motor Generator Unit \u2013 Kinetic) output will increase to 470 bhp (350 kW) \u2013 previously the MGU-K had a maximum power output of 160 bhp (120 kW). The power output of the internal combustion part of the power unit will decrease to 540 bhp (400 kW) from 850 bhp (630 kW). In addition, fuel flow rates will be limited based on theoretical energy available from rule-specified unified composition, rather than mass of the various fuel from different sources. There is also intended to be further restrictions on components such as MGU-Ks and exhausts imposed from 2027. The new power units are due to be run on a fully sustainable fuel, being developed by Formula One.\nAudi are due to become an engine provider from 2026 onwards. Ford are due to partner with Red Bull Powertrains as Red Bull Ford Powertrains from 2026 after a 20-year absence. Honda, under its subsidiary Honda Racing Corporation, has also entered as a manufacturer for 2026 according to the FIA after officially leaving the sport in 2021. The FIA also confirmed that Ferrari, Mercedes-AMG and Alpine (Renault) were registered as power unit suppliers for 2026. However, on 30 September 2024, owing to lack of strong results with its power unit during the V6 turbo-hybrid era since it began in 2014, Renault announced it would be ending its engine programme following the conclusion of the 2025 championship and would not be making engines for the new 2026 regulations after all. A 2025 FIA proposal to end the 2026 engine formula for 2028 and switch to sustainably fuelled naturally aspirated V10 engines was rejected by teams. On 23 April 2025, the FIA confirmed that General Motors through its Cadillac brand would become a power unit supplier from the 2029 season onwards. The Cadillac Formula One Team were already announced as joining the grid from the 2026 season onwards using customer Ferrari power units for an interim period whilst the Cadillac engine is developed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 35239, "end_char_idx": 39816, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cec1bff4-cf72-4692-be3b-505891139ec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cec1bff4-cf72-4692-be3b-505891139ec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11034903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe1260081e3c5026e6efdb8e3cd8f49871c4dcc0c39b1d278de1e778fb546c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b47800bc-aac6-40f8-8027-135fa28d4d86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9aa602f9c080312b90b102b51565c2ac2adf61e5c37dbc1516d2d0818a335073", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Engine regulation progression by era ===\n\n Notes:\n\n\n=== Current engine technical specifications ===\n\n\n==== Combustion, construction, operation, power and fuel ====\nManufacturers: Mercedes-Benz, Renault (including TAG Heuer rebadging until 2018), Ferrari and Red Bull Powertrains (Honda)\nType: Hybrid-powered 4-stroke piston.

The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.\nA points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors\u2014now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.\nFormula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.\nWith the average annual cost of running a team\u2014e.g. designing, building, and maintaining cars; staff payroll; transport\u2014at approximately \u00a3220 million, Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for US$8 billion.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1905, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58610c22-88a2-409f-82e5-0a26af9912a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "58610c22-88a2-409f-82e5-0a26af9912a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0dcb8d38-3580-437e-9b52-393402ea01ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dabf54f789ba65b7e45f1a478035e27a3f6eed54b9a169216ae55f89a8822ce6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5cf7608-21fb-4b66-b21f-1a50c16f97d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da7f4ac76986b597f84bcebea63be069b43d95eddb5b8d5638c97b81859165a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== History ==\n\nFormula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925\u20131930) and European Drivers' Championship (1931\u20131939). The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start. Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.\nThe first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957. This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.\n\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times. Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered\u2014still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.\nThis era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1908, "end_char_idx": 4777, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5cf7608-21fb-4b66-b21f-1a50c16f97d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5cf7608-21fb-4b66-b21f-1a50c16f97d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58610c22-88a2-409f-82e5-0a26af9912a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f9cb2004343712d0b0f9a91dc77279eb1a13aa5559aa3b64630df179b80a3d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c338c3fa-406a-4384-81ed-8f3dec6fc681", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e860c8cf5d550bc090f2fb4e9d271e25f45db9f2005f7c3ef4728e73dec5a6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Technological developments ===\n\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.\nDuring 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.\nIn 1968, sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1968. Five months later, the first works team, Lotus, initially using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red, gold, and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.\nAerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.\n\n\n=== Big business ===\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multi-billion dollar business it now is. When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA. He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.\nThe formation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA\u2013FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations. The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley \"used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view\". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races. The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations. Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.\nFISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983. But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar. These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in 1989.\nThe development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4780, "end_char_idx": 9274, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c338c3fa-406a-4384-81ed-8f3dec6fc681": {"__data__": {"id_": "c338c3fa-406a-4384-81ed-8f3dec6fc681", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5cf7608-21fb-4b66-b21f-1a50c16f97d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da7f4ac76986b597f84bcebea63be069b43d95eddb5b8d5638c97b81859165a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2686b091-693f-44ff-ae23-d63952553da7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61471cb6845d634fcfd4ade91089607b0fd7723ce39d0246bb66259ec3b4db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.

Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".\nThe teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.\n\nOn the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, one at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSince Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams\u2014most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.\n\nResults were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship from 1979 to 2008, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8576, "end_char_idx": 13057, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2686b091-693f-44ff-ae23-d63952553da7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2686b091-693f-44ff-ae23-d63952553da7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c338c3fa-406a-4384-81ed-8f3dec6fc681", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e860c8cf5d550bc090f2fb4e9d271e25f45db9f2005f7c3ef4728e73dec5a6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5386d35e-d4f0-47a7-86b1-160011be12c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f833747fc47a0920bf04b1c9880d2c2a1cac5f577ba073ca86052729178a8380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.\n\n\n=== Manufacturers' return ===\n Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000\u20132004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999\u20132004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021). Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\nDuring this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs. Team orders, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A 'tyre war' between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall, although, at the 2005 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20 December 2007 Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.\nDuring 2006, Max Mosley outlined a 'green' future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor.\nStarting in 2000, with Ford's purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo's and Renault's departures in 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams\u2014Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and Ferrari\u2014dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz. Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12240, "end_char_idx": 16151, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5386d35e-d4f0-47a7-86b1-160011be12c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5386d35e-d4f0-47a7-86b1-160011be12c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2686b091-693f-44ff-ae23-d63952553da7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61471cb6845d634fcfd4ade91089607b0fd7723ce39d0246bb66259ec3b4db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5a8ba45-cd85-40d4-92a9-d0f87812685a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "878d080082de3775027e6cabe5ddcc1029dbd71300732283ee8d28acc68a04c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Manufacturers' decline and return of the privateers ===\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors. But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.\nMcLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road car project and tough F1 championships, which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on Ferrari). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.\nDuring the 2009 season, Formula One was gripped by the FIA\u2013FOTA dispute. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams; teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a rev limiter. The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and Force India, that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.\n\nOn 24 June, Formula One's governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified, and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October. Following further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection, FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season, and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting. On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus\u2014led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing\u2014the first Spanish Formula One team; and Virgin Racing\u2014Richard Branson's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams\u2014which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams\u2014ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.\n\n\n=== Hybrid era ===\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season.

This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in 2015 before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points. The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain.\n\nAfter revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the 2017 and 2018 seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari. Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years, eventually winning seven consecutive Drivers' Championships from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. During this eight-year period between 2014 and 2021, a Mercedes driver won 111 of the 160 races, with Hamilton winning 81 of these and taking six Drivers' Championships during this period to equal Schumacher's record of seven titles. In 2021, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.\nThis era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda's return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the Lotus F1 Team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season, while Racing Point part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for 2021. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022, with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced. The start of the 2020 season was delayed by several months, and both it and 2021 seasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing.\nIn 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations. Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The 2022 and 2023 Constructors' and Drivers' Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.\nIn 2023 the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula 1 in the then near future. Of the teams that applied, only Andretti were approved by the FIA, with them then being rejected by Formula One Management, though they have launched an appeal.\nIn early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake.com, resulting in the team's new identity as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber. Sauber will hold Stake's sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards. Scuderia AlphaTauri, Red Bull's junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming Visa Cash App RB, or VCARB for 2024.

A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.\n\n\n=== Tyre rules ===\n\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.\n\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race. As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix, whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards' discretion.\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix. The system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the 'sprint'. From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout'; such a system made its debut at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres \u2013 mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 \u2013 otherwise they cannot participate in the session.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25259, "end_char_idx": 30717, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "264dff29-28e5-46b2-a841-b69569640178": {"__data__": {"id_": "264dff29-28e5-46b2-a841-b69569640178", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "649ac99a-4798-40c3-a4fe-bd6f63c24c4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09cb3a4837c0726ddcfe3c160a75c08ffb9f0c563c91a5b13d5f738ca177eb3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6647126e-2cf7-4c09-a765-16e0211c6079", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00d4e76697ca831cac4204737832be74018f2eceb9c7897dd36bed15ed751977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Race ===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardized to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989, with the exception of the Monaco Grand Prix, which has a shorter distance due to its slower speeds and the need to keep the race under two hours.\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\". Drivers who are about to be lapped are supposed to literally go out of their way and let the \"lapping\" driver pass easily. Research documents that drivers - despite being supposed to - often do not defer to the lapping driver and engage in resistance. Once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\nThroughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies.\nUnder wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 30720, "end_char_idx": 35352, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6647126e-2cf7-4c09-a765-16e0211c6079": {"__data__": {"id_": "6647126e-2cf7-4c09-a765-16e0211c6079", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "264dff29-28e5-46b2-a841-b69569640178", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d83ff7cd8e139041d2565feb90530641367eb2b8efe203c0eb4db3188fc1b4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "150980b6-c48c-4691-8ee7-7a1902174b2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ba556b57835c0b5bb6e0e0e6e3dcc1bcfcffe5ddaf39cd24e4898e4f7f676b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Throughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel).

If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use two types of dry tyres.\n\n\n==== Race director ====\n\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in parc ferm\u00e9 before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers. The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations. As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.\n\n\n==== Safety car ====\n\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with no overtaking permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a rolling start. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pit lane, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\nMercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996. From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage to share duties with Mercedes-AMGs.\n\nSince 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder. He is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.\n\n\n===== Virtual Safety Car =====\n\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimise the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags.

When the virtual safety car is deployed, the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\". All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta. The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, before being upgraded to a full safety car, following a collision between Max Verstappen and Romain Grosjean.\n\n\n=== Flags ===\n\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code.\n\nThe format of the race has changed little through Formula One's history. The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem \u2013 in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations.\nSince the 2010 season, refuelling \u2013 which was reintroduced in 1994 \u2013 has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n\n=== Points system ===\n\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers' Championship.\nA driver must be classified in order to receive points, as of 2022, a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.\nFrom some time between the 1977 and 1980 seasons to the end of the 2021 season if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the 1984 season. The last occurrence was at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car because of torrential rain. The half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent gradual scale system for 2022.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 37919, "end_char_idx": 41315, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "215a872c-f2f8-4436-822c-df839e9276f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "215a872c-f2f8-4436-822c-df839e9276f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "150980b6-c48c-4691-8ee7-7a1902174b2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ba556b57835c0b5bb6e0e0e6e3dcc1bcfcffe5ddaf39cd24e4898e4f7f676b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4e536f4-7198-4ee0-914d-8c2f77b001ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aae7f2fc4ae4226991779cd8f4e300688623ec23bfa5068caf253302ec3e6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Constructors ==\n\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine. If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983). Constructors that share the engine with another constructor pay close attention - not just to their own performance - but also to the performance of other constructors using the same engine when assessing whether to extend their collaboration with an engine manufacturer.\nSince 1981, Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the distinction between the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced by a different entity. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"spec series\" such as Formula 2 which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits privateers, which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\nThe sport's debut season, 1950, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"works team\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen).\nCompanies such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertec, which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier. It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200 million ($125\u2013$225 million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams. Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis, The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT team in 2010 and Haas currently.\nAlthough teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated they range from US$66 million to US$400 million each.\nEntering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $200 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams. As a consequence, constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: BAR's purchase of Tyrrell and Midland's purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had, such as TV revenue.\nSeven out of the ten teams competing in Formula One are based in England, in an area centred around Oxford. Ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. The RB Formula One Team is based close to Ferrari in Faenza, whilst Sauber Motorsport is based near Zurich in Switzerland.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41318, "end_char_idx": 45631, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4e536f4-7198-4ee0-914d-8c2f77b001ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4e536f4-7198-4ee0-914d-8c2f77b001ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "215a872c-f2f8-4436-822c-df839e9276f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b63a20d4c78aacaf0b378592c0156a121cc58a55d2d07a1218e1ca37da4febd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1f5c149-e0bf-4f16-940d-6a8bc352bde3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b236377b33c3cd6f247539a4b34bddda55c6ff796e1744d45357dbeface14a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Drivers ==\n\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria. Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\nTeams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers' role mainly takes places on a simulator, such as rFpro, which is used by most of the F1 teams.\nEach driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi) upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one. At the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.\nPermanent numbers were introduced in 1973 to take effect in 1974, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13 which had been unused since 1976.\n\nAs teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari's 27 and 28. A different system was used from 1996 to 2013: at the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season's Constructors' Championship order.\nAs of 2024, a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too, in 2020. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers, and 319 wins.\n\n\n=== Physical demands ===\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2\u20134 kg (4\u20139 lb) of weight per race. A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 gs when cornering, 6 gs when braking and 2 gs when accelerating. When a driver experiences 6 g, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb). Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing. The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40\u201350 newton-metres (30\u201337 lb\u22c5ft), while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal. Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance. Drivers also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can average more than 170 bpm during a race; this is more than a healthy adult would typically experience while running.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45634, "end_char_idx": 50462, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1f5c149-e0bf-4f16-940d-6a8bc352bde3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1f5c149-e0bf-4f16-940d-6a8bc352bde3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4e536f4-7198-4ee0-914d-8c2f77b001ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aae7f2fc4ae4226991779cd8f4e300688623ec23bfa5068caf253302ec3e6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d43e7718-350c-417f-a18e-3209ba2f4ffa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2246a14b592ae77958d80bb701a281fc1ea53584bc54474ff601e8fd35a19280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Feeder series ===\n\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions and then progress through traditional entry level European single-seater series such as Formula Ford, Formula Renault, and Formula 4. From there, drivers typically progress to higher level regional championships at the Formula Three level. This included championships like British F3 and European F3 historically, although similar series now hold the Formula Regional designation. In addition to this, there are also international F3 championships, including GP3 and its present-day successor FIA F3. The highest level series on the F1 ladder is the FIA Formula 2 Championship. In the past, the top level series was GP2 (2005\u20132016), International Formula 3000 (1985\u20132004 under the Formula 3000 class), and Formula Two (1948\u20131984).\nDrivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika H\u00e4kkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One, and Max Verstappen made his F1 debut following a single season in European F3. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.\nAmerican open-wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid. CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F1 World Champions, while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F1.\n\n\n== Grands Prix ==\n\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2024 season contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season. There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races.\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953, and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in 1958. Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in 1976 and Australia in 1985), and the first race in the Middle East was held in 2004. The 19 races of the 2014 season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.\nSome of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night race in 2008, which was followed by the day\u2013night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.\n\n\n=== Contracted Grands Prix ===\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50465, "end_char_idx": 54660, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d43e7718-350c-417f-a18e-3209ba2f4ffa": {"__data__": {"id_": "d43e7718-350c-417f-a18e-3209ba2f4ffa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1f5c149-e0bf-4f16-940d-6a8bc352bde3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b236377b33c3cd6f247539a4b34bddda55c6ff796e1744d45357dbeface14a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e36369a-3fc6-4ad1-8b7b-2bb7781a6a28", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "765a9617160b5f4c440056cce97aa81c0ea0d21b7a3e0abb54066a83cebe989d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Contracted Grands Prix ===\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.\n\n\n=== Returning additions (2008\u2013present) ===\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\n\nEuropean Grand Prix at Valencia Street Circuit (2008\u20132012)\nUnited States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (2012\u20132019, 2021\u2013present)\nAustrian Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring (2014\u2013present)\nMexican Grand Prix at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez (2015\u20132019); renamed Mexico City Grand Prix (2021\u2013present)\nEuropean Grand Prix at Baku City Circuit (2016; renamed the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for 2017\u20132019, 2021\u2013present)\nFrench Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard (2018\u20132019, 2021\u20132022)\nPortuguese Grand Prix at Algarve International Circuit (2020\u20132021)\nImola Circuit with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix (2020\u20132022, 2024\u2013present; previously hosted the Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix)\nDutch Grand Prix at Circuit Zandvoort (2021\u2013present)\n\n\n=== New Locations Initiative (2008\u2013present) ===\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\nSince 2008, the Formula One Group has been targeting new \"destination cities\" to expand its global reach, with the aim to produce races from countries that have not previously been involved in the sport. This initiative started with the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\n\n== Circuits ==\n\nFormula One races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks. The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations. In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\nA typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars. Special pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\". The Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA's minimum race distance requirement\u2014the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit, added in 2004 and designed \u2013 like most of F1's new circuits \u2013 by Hermann Tilke. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\nThe Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996. In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985.

The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 800 kg (1,800 lb) \u2013 the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.\nThe cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From 1998 to 2008, the tyres in Formula One were not \"slicks\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars. Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the 2009 season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis \u2013 one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their 2012 car. Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In 2022, McLaren (MCL36) and Red Bull Racing (RB18) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.\nCarbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for maximum performance and cooling.\nIn 2022, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence (commonly referred to as \"dirty air\") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the turbulent air. (See 2022 Formula One World Championship Technical regulations)\nFormula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction. As of 2022, the wheels are covered with \"spec\" (Standardised) Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the \"tyre profile\"), and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.\n\nStarting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units. These get a significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol. The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000 rpm and produced over 580 kW (780 bhp). For 2007, engines were restricted to 19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since the end of 2006.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58826, "end_char_idx": 63383, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1332659b-b39e-4d31-ace7-414414d5d078": {"__data__": {"id_": "1332659b-b39e-4d31-ace7-414414d5d078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e36369a-3fc6-4ad1-8b7b-2bb7781a6a28", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "765a9617160b5f4c440056cce97aa81c0ea0d21b7a3e0abb54066a83cebe989d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d05531e3-53eb-4a6d-9615-6aee8b03fafa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c149375eba6fcd7786dff672738e671170c01de506212655153364841dee922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Starting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units.

For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000 rpm.\nA wide variety of technologies \u2013 including active suspension are banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h (220 mph) at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. During qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph). A BAR-Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.\nEven with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to \"drive on the ceiling\", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering. Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around 1g.\nAs of 2019, each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time. Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team. If more engines are used, they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used. The only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season, in which case up to five may be used by a driver.

The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.\nCosts vary greatly from team to team. Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $200 million on engines in 2006, Renault spent approximately $125 million and Cosworth's 2006 V8 was developed for $15 million. In contrast to the 2006 season on which these figures are based, the 2007 sporting regulations banned all performance-related engine development.\nFormula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors' Championship. Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee, which in 2013 was \u20ac10,000 plus \u20ac1,000 per point.\nThere have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015, Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.\nThe cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as Albert Park, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as MotoGP. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300 million and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150 million to build.\nA number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing. The highest-paid driver in 2021 is Lewis Hamilton, who received $55 million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 \u2013 a record for any driver. The very top Formula One drivers get paid more than IndyCar or NASCAR drivers; however, the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F1 drivers, and the majority of NASCAR racers will make more money than their F1 counterparts. Most top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122 million and an income of $24 million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company grossed revenues of $620 million for the same quarter the previous year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 64993, "end_char_idx": 68761, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "962a3a74-62af-4677-b5e8-d3c7bfc36fd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "962a3a74-62af-4677-b5e8-d3c7bfc36fd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d05531e3-53eb-4a6d-9615-6aee8b03fafa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c149375eba6fcd7786dff672738e671170c01de506212655153364841dee922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f624929-1711-4a52-bb88-09d9818649b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba6d0a5ea2bc435230c66ecdf8268a5cd8ba23ac49cd9ad5f14c541f1c4a51ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Cost cap ===\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport's governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.\nFor instance, in 2019, the richest teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari spent $420 million and $435 million respectively, whereas teams such as Williams or Haas, only spent $125 million and $150 million respectively. This gap was widening by the season and disparities like this prompted the FIA to introduce a cost cap in February 2021.\nThe FIA proposed the cost cap as a measure to reward engineering prowess over sheer expenditure. They did this in an effort to bridge the gap between the midfield teams and the teams challenging for the driver's and constructors' titles.\nThe cap was $175 million in 2021, although was reduced further to $145 million in response to economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2022, the cost cap was further reduced to $140 million and in 2023 it fell to $135 million where it will remain for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.\nThe 2022 season served as a critical test for the effectiveness of the cost cap as it was the year the new regulations were introduced, allowing all teams to start from scratch and build a car that was independent of the previous years. Critics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient to close the gap in competition because it excluded certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs along with loopholes that allowed the likes of Adrian Newey's salary of Red Bull to be excluded from the cost cap. They also contended that established teams could exploit existing infrastructures and resources accumulated over years, thus maintaining their competitive edge despite the spending limits.\nHowever, an alternative perspective highlights that the cost cap encourages teams to maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the 2023 season as the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points with Lando Norris at P17 and Oscar Piastri at P20. Seven months later, with the right upgrades, they managed to be the fastest car on the grid throughout qualifying and race pace. Facing budgetary constraints similar to their competitors, McLaren focused on strategic engineering upgrades and talent development. Their significant mid-season improvements led to notable on-track success, demonstrating that with clever resource management and engineering talent, teams can challenge the dominance of traditionally wealthier competitors.\nMcLaren CEO Zak Brown said that \"the cap has been outstanding for the sport.\" He also went on to say that there is a feeling that at any point in the season, any team can challenge for a place it wasn't equipped to do so at the start of the season.\nThe critics have expressed that the impact of the cost cap suggests that engineering excellence and strategic ingenuity can indeed offset the advantages of larger budgets. By promoting a more balanced competitive environment, the cost cap has made Formula 1 more exciting for fans and more viable for teams.\n\n\n== Future ==\n\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.\nFollowing their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in 2017, Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport's relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.\nOn 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement.

This came into effect at the start of the 2021 season and changed how prize money and TV revenue is distributed.\n\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nFormula One has initiated a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. By 2025, all events should have become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.\nA report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the 2019 season, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and only 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: \"As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations. We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards.\"\nFrom the 2021\u201322 season, all cars increased the bio-component of their fuel, using E10 fuel, rather than the 5.75% of ethanol previously used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future. In December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability, to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.\n\n\n=== Social inequities ===\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative. The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\". The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport. The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007.\nIn addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport's cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white. Due to the results of the study, the team changed the car's livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 2025.\nThe 20 drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track. Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore \"End Racism\" shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities. In the year since, Lewis Hamilton has remained vocal in his pre-race attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.\n\n\n== Women in Formula One ==\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score.

The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019, 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.\n\n\n=== F1 Academy ===\nF1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garc\u00eda of Prema Racing. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport; Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.\n\n\n=== Female Formula One drivers ===\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first woman to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.\nLella Lombardi is the only woman to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races, and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, Lombardi became the first and only woman to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion half points were awarded and Lombardi only gained .5 points.\nDesir\u00e9 Wilson is the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the 1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship.\nGiovanna Amati was the last female driver to attempt to qualify for a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1992, she was signed by Brabham and participated in three races\u2014South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil\u2014but failed to qualify for any of them. Amati faced significant challenges, including an underperforming car and limited testing opportunities. She was replaced by Damon Hill after Brabham struggled with financial difficulties and performance issues. Despite not making a race start, her entry remains significant, as no woman has attempted to qualify for a Grand Prix since. Her participation also marked the last time a female driver was officially listed on an F1 entry list until Susie Wolff took part in free practice sessions for Williams in 2014.\n\n\n=== Race engineers ===\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing.\nBeginning in 2025, Laura M\u00fcller has served as the race engineer for Esteban Ocon at Haas, making her the first female to serve as a race engineer on a full time basis.\n\n\n=== Team principals ===\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing. In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\nAustrian Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first ever female Team principal when she took over the role at Sauber Formula 1 Team in 2010.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 76468, "end_char_idx": 80410, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7e833b2-bb5b-46ad-85f1-0028b651d643": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7e833b2-bb5b-46ad-85f1-0028b651d643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f5673be-97bc-4dbc-ad5d-de752e89d971", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e003247ec375d2d415b50a8d550512243130b5c04fddde49ca112a487f98c68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "553e3024-4de8-4bad-81bd-2f65c6d1ac15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f34a009cd8923e4cfabd3dbb5cfcfdb0ef30d8af27915cce613d44dd41b63ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Team principals ===\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades.

The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race. The cumulative television audience for the 2001 season, which was broadcast to 200 territories, was calculated to be 54 billion.\nDuring the early 1990s, Formula One Group introduced updated branding, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website in an attempt to give the competition a corporate identity.\nAll broadcasters are provided with an identical world feed produced by Formula One Management (FOM), though for some races it was previously provided by local broadcasters. The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds \u2013 a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\nAn enhanced package called F1 Digital+ was launched by FOM in 1996, which included live broadcast of all sessions live as well as additional channels including onboard and pit-lane cameras. It was initially only offered in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, though it later became available in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The service was never financially viable and was discontinued at the end of the 2002 season.\nOn 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the HD format for the 2011 season.\nThe official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store since 2009, and on Google Play since 2011, that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary. On 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous \"flying one\" in use since 1993.\nIn March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary. In April 2024, FOM launched a free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States, which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 79594, "end_char_idx": 83050, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "553e3024-4de8-4bad-81bd-2f65c6d1ac15": {"__data__": {"id_": "553e3024-4de8-4bad-81bd-2f65c6d1ac15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7e833b2-bb5b-46ad-85f1-0028b651d643", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31c3c8ad869937188a3529b9839c576f9f88cc3111560f0d8f46bc77d2cf87b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "960dd0ce-cfae-4a80-af21-a353ac4b49f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14e2603c90768025b74b5d2113b9ea772b9fadb942646566ff137bfca2d3f2d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Television broadcasters ===\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 from 2012 to 2018. Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1 which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows. In 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season. The BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season, three years earlier than planned. The free-to-air TV rights were picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season. Sky Sports F1 coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra coverage was extended until 2021. As of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until 2024.\nIn south-east Asia, the middle east and north Africa, Formula One is broadcast by beIN Sports. In India, sessions are broadcast by streaming service FanCode and satellite television provider Tata Play. In China, the rights are held by Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV.\nIn the United States, ESPN has held the rights since 2013, carrying the broadcast and commentary feed provided by Sky Sports UK. Some races are also broadcast free-to-air on ABC under the ESPN on ABC banner. According to The Athletic, the fee paid by ESPN is estimated at $90 million per year as of 2025, with the current deal set to expire after the 2025 season.\nIn Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the exclusive rights are held by pay TV broadcaster Sky Sport. The rights were previously shared with free-to-air channel RTL for many years, which had broadcast all Formula One qualifying and racing sessions since 1991, but lost its rights after the 2020 season due to being outbid by Sky Sport. Despite no longer holding the rights themselves, RTL has broadcast selected sessions on free-to-air television and its streaming service RTL+ as part of various sublicensing agreements with Sky Sport.\nIn France, Formula One is currently broadcast by pay TV channel Canal+, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.\n\n\n== Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races ==\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous. Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations. However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\n\nThe first Formula One race was held in 1946, whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship; in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the 1983 Race of Champions.\nThe World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\nThe World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e. without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 race counted towards the World Championship. This race was run to American Automobile Association, and later United States Automobile Club, Championship Car regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, Alberto Ascari in 1952, started at Indianapolis during this period.\nFrom 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations. Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the List of Formula One drivers, Clemente Biondetti is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950, but only one of these counted for the World Championship.\nIn the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 83053, "end_char_idx": 87739, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "960dd0ce-cfae-4a80-af21-a353ac4b49f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "960dd0ce-cfae-4a80-af21-a353ac4b49f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "553e3024-4de8-4bad-81bd-2f65c6d1ac15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f34a009cd8923e4cfabd3dbb5cfcfdb0ef30d8af27915cce613d44dd41b63ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== European non-championship racing ===\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in 1950 a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the Race of Champions, Oulton Park International Gold Cup and the International Trophy, were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid. These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.\n\n\n=== South African Formula One championship ===\n\nSouth Africa's domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there were also locally built or modified cars.\n\n\n=== British Formula One Championship ===\n\nThe DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980, the series saw South African Desir\u00e9 Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFormula One video games\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n Media related to Formula One at Wikimedia Commons", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 87742, "end_char_idx": 90228, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aa0fd65-30de-49a2-be25-8464f6d417dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aa0fd65-30de-49a2-be25-8464f6d417dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "697369", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc0bce3bc6de030b5b222bbe2ea7dcbeef76e496f8fe0af580da8d0c1cbd5a67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.

The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.\nA points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors\u2014now synonymous with teams.

The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994.

The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start. Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.\nThe first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957. This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.\n\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times. Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered\u2014still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.\nThis era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1908, "end_char_idx": 4777, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "721facf2-9f04-46e6-92f5-e96224f1c99e": {"__data__": {"id_": "721facf2-9f04-46e6-92f5-e96224f1c99e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "554dab60-e217-40f6-a895-2bff1bb62ff4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f9cb2004343712d0b0f9a91dc77279eb1a13aa5559aa3b64630df179b80a3d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f00e322-e7fb-4305-84cb-c8ade3b929d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e860c8cf5d550bc090f2fb4e9d271e25f45db9f2005f7c3ef4728e73dec5a6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Technological developments ===\n\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.\nDuring 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.\nIn 1968, sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1968. Five months later, the first works team, Lotus, initially using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red, gold, and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.\nAerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.\n\n\n=== Big business ===\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multi-billion dollar business it now is. When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA. He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.\nThe formation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA\u2013FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations. The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley \"used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view\". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races. The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations. Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.\nFISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983. But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar. These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in 1989.\nThe development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4780, "end_char_idx": 9274, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f00e322-e7fb-4305-84cb-c8ade3b929d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f00e322-e7fb-4305-84cb-c8ade3b929d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "721facf2-9f04-46e6-92f5-e96224f1c99e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da7f4ac76986b597f84bcebea63be069b43d95eddb5b8d5638c97b81859165a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d87467c-b26d-4541-b168-bf184d440513", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61471cb6845d634fcfd4ade91089607b0fd7723ce39d0246bb66259ec3b4db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.

Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".\nThe teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.\n\nOn the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, one at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSince Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams\u2014most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.\n\nResults were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship from 1979 to 2008, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8576, "end_char_idx": 13057, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d87467c-b26d-4541-b168-bf184d440513": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d87467c-b26d-4541-b168-bf184d440513", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f00e322-e7fb-4305-84cb-c8ade3b929d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e860c8cf5d550bc090f2fb4e9d271e25f45db9f2005f7c3ef4728e73dec5a6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d69aa41a-5498-43c2-9e5c-d77ebb073788", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f833747fc47a0920bf04b1c9880d2c2a1cac5f577ba073ca86052729178a8380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.\n\n\n=== Manufacturers' return ===\n Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000\u20132004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999\u20132004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021). Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\nDuring this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs. Team orders, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A 'tyre war' between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall, although, at the 2005 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20 December 2007 Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.\nDuring 2006, Max Mosley outlined a 'green' future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor.\nStarting in 2000, with Ford's purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo's and Renault's departures in 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams\u2014Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and Ferrari\u2014dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz. Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12240, "end_char_idx": 16151, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d69aa41a-5498-43c2-9e5c-d77ebb073788": {"__data__": {"id_": "d69aa41a-5498-43c2-9e5c-d77ebb073788", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d87467c-b26d-4541-b168-bf184d440513", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61471cb6845d634fcfd4ade91089607b0fd7723ce39d0246bb66259ec3b4db4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38967861-60fe-4338-8afc-7839780b0e4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "878d080082de3775027e6cabe5ddcc1029dbd71300732283ee8d28acc68a04c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Manufacturers' decline and return of the privateers ===\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors. But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.\nMcLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road car project and tough F1 championships, which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on Ferrari). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.\nDuring the 2009 season, Formula One was gripped by the FIA\u2013FOTA dispute. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams; teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a rev limiter. The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and Force India, that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.\n\nOn 24 June, Formula One's governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified, and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October. Following further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection, FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season, and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting. On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus\u2014led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing\u2014the first Spanish Formula One team; and Virgin Racing\u2014Richard Branson's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams\u2014which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams\u2014ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.\n\n\n=== Hybrid era ===\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season.

This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in 2015 before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points. The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain.\n\nAfter revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the 2017 and 2018 seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari. Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years, eventually winning seven consecutive Drivers' Championships from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. During this eight-year period between 2014 and 2021, a Mercedes driver won 111 of the 160 races, with Hamilton winning 81 of these and taking six Drivers' Championships during this period to equal Schumacher's record of seven titles. In 2021, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.\nThis era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda's return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the Lotus F1 Team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season, while Racing Point part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for 2021. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022, with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced. The start of the 2020 season was delayed by several months, and both it and 2021 seasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing.\nIn 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations. Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The 2022 and 2023 Constructors' and Drivers' Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.\nIn 2023 the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula 1 in the then near future. Of the teams that applied, only Andretti were approved by the FIA, with them then being rejected by Formula One Management, though they have launched an appeal.\nIn early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake.com, resulting in the team's new identity as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber. Sauber will hold Stake's sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards. Scuderia AlphaTauri, Red Bull's junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming Visa Cash App RB, or VCARB for 2024.

A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.\n\n\n=== Tyre rules ===\n\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.\n\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race. As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix, whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards' discretion.\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix. The system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the 'sprint'. From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout'; such a system made its debut at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres \u2013 mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 \u2013 otherwise they cannot participate in the session.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25259, "end_char_idx": 30717, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c296e486-807f-4e59-a779-d7353fe1286d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c296e486-807f-4e59-a779-d7353fe1286d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5209fd22-4b2c-47f4-8bc2-ad83b68d84be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09cb3a4837c0726ddcfe3c160a75c08ffb9f0c563c91a5b13d5f738ca177eb3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4eccbcf8-8961-4fbc-a33d-c0c8e41c8770", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00d4e76697ca831cac4204737832be74018f2eceb9c7897dd36bed15ed751977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Race ===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardized to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989, with the exception of the Monaco Grand Prix, which has a shorter distance due to its slower speeds and the need to keep the race under two hours.\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\". Drivers who are about to be lapped are supposed to literally go out of their way and let the \"lapping\" driver pass easily. Research documents that drivers - despite being supposed to - often do not defer to the lapping driver and engage in resistance. Once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\nThroughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies.\nUnder wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 30720, "end_char_idx": 35352, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4eccbcf8-8961-4fbc-a33d-c0c8e41c8770": {"__data__": {"id_": "4eccbcf8-8961-4fbc-a33d-c0c8e41c8770", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c296e486-807f-4e59-a779-d7353fe1286d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d83ff7cd8e139041d2565feb90530641367eb2b8efe203c0eb4db3188fc1b4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e54fd24f-9e0e-4447-a67d-429d6c7850f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ba556b57835c0b5bb6e0e0e6e3dcc1bcfcffe5ddaf39cd24e4898e4f7f676b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Throughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel).

If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use two types of dry tyres.\n\n\n==== Race director ====\n\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in parc ferm\u00e9 before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers. The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations. As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.\n\n\n==== Safety car ====\n\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with no overtaking permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a rolling start. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pit lane, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\nMercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996. From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage to share duties with Mercedes-AMGs.\n\nSince 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder. He is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.\n\n\n===== Virtual Safety Car =====\n\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimise the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags.

When the virtual safety car is deployed, the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\". All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta. The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, before being upgraded to a full safety car, following a collision between Max Verstappen and Romain Grosjean.\n\n\n=== Flags ===\n\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code.\n\nThe format of the race has changed little through Formula One's history. The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem \u2013 in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations.\nSince the 2010 season, refuelling \u2013 which was reintroduced in 1994 \u2013 has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n\n=== Points system ===\n\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers' Championship.\nA driver must be classified in order to receive points, as of 2022, a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.\nFrom some time between the 1977 and 1980 seasons to the end of the 2021 season if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the 1984 season. The last occurrence was at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car because of torrential rain. The half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent gradual scale system for 2022.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 37919, "end_char_idx": 41315, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb64271b-3638-4917-843c-b7db1cad515a": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb64271b-3638-4917-843c-b7db1cad515a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e54fd24f-9e0e-4447-a67d-429d6c7850f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ba556b57835c0b5bb6e0e0e6e3dcc1bcfcffe5ddaf39cd24e4898e4f7f676b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16a7e3c9-4d02-4099-8c8b-828ef7d72be0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aae7f2fc4ae4226991779cd8f4e300688623ec23bfa5068caf253302ec3e6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Constructors ==\n\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine. If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983). Constructors that share the engine with another constructor pay close attention - not just to their own performance - but also to the performance of other constructors using the same engine when assessing whether to extend their collaboration with an engine manufacturer.\nSince 1981, Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the distinction between the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced by a different entity. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"spec series\" such as Formula 2 which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits privateers, which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\nThe sport's debut season, 1950, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"works team\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen).\nCompanies such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertec, which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier. It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200 million ($125\u2013$225 million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams. Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis, The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT team in 2010 and Haas currently.\nAlthough teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated they range from US$66 million to US$400 million each.\nEntering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $200 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams. As a consequence, constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: BAR's purchase of Tyrrell and Midland's purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had, such as TV revenue.\nSeven out of the ten teams competing in Formula One are based in England, in an area centred around Oxford. Ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. The RB Formula One Team is based close to Ferrari in Faenza, whilst Sauber Motorsport is based near Zurich in Switzerland.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41318, "end_char_idx": 45631, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16a7e3c9-4d02-4099-8c8b-828ef7d72be0": {"__data__": {"id_": "16a7e3c9-4d02-4099-8c8b-828ef7d72be0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb64271b-3638-4917-843c-b7db1cad515a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b63a20d4c78aacaf0b378592c0156a121cc58a55d2d07a1218e1ca37da4febd1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "88f4ec6c-1d6d-4fc8-9b25-b53d1972a5f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b236377b33c3cd6f247539a4b34bddda55c6ff796e1744d45357dbeface14a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Drivers ==\n\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria. Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\nTeams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers' role mainly takes places on a simulator, such as rFpro, which is used by most of the F1 teams.\nEach driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi) upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one. At the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.\nPermanent numbers were introduced in 1973 to take effect in 1974, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13 which had been unused since 1976.\n\nAs teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari's 27 and 28. A different system was used from 1996 to 2013: at the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season's Constructors' Championship order.\nAs of 2024, a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too, in 2020. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers, and 319 wins.\n\n\n=== Physical demands ===\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2\u20134 kg (4\u20139 lb) of weight per race. A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 gs when cornering, 6 gs when braking and 2 gs when accelerating. When a driver experiences 6 g, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb). Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing. The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40\u201350 newton-metres (30\u201337 lb\u22c5ft), while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal. Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance. Drivers also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can average more than 170 bpm during a race; this is more than a healthy adult would typically experience while running.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45634, "end_char_idx": 50462, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88f4ec6c-1d6d-4fc8-9b25-b53d1972a5f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "88f4ec6c-1d6d-4fc8-9b25-b53d1972a5f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16a7e3c9-4d02-4099-8c8b-828ef7d72be0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3aae7f2fc4ae4226991779cd8f4e300688623ec23bfa5068caf253302ec3e6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e06c711-7385-4a50-a966-4d71d9889931", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2246a14b592ae77958d80bb701a281fc1ea53584bc54474ff601e8fd35a19280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Feeder series ===\n\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions and then progress through traditional entry level European single-seater series such as Formula Ford, Formula Renault, and Formula 4. From there, drivers typically progress to higher level regional championships at the Formula Three level. This included championships like British F3 and European F3 historically, although similar series now hold the Formula Regional designation. In addition to this, there are also international F3 championships, including GP3 and its present-day successor FIA F3. The highest level series on the F1 ladder is the FIA Formula 2 Championship. In the past, the top level series was GP2 (2005\u20132016), International Formula 3000 (1985\u20132004 under the Formula 3000 class), and Formula Two (1948\u20131984).\nDrivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika H\u00e4kkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One, and Max Verstappen made his F1 debut following a single season in European F3. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.\nAmerican open-wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid. CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F1 World Champions, while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F1.\n\n\n== Grands Prix ==\n\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2024 season contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season. There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races.\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953, and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in 1958. Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in 1976 and Australia in 1985), and the first race in the Middle East was held in 2004. The 19 races of the 2014 season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.\nSome of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night race in 2008, which was followed by the day\u2013night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.\n\n\n=== Contracted Grands Prix ===\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50465, "end_char_idx": 54660, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e06c711-7385-4a50-a966-4d71d9889931": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e06c711-7385-4a50-a966-4d71d9889931", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88f4ec6c-1d6d-4fc8-9b25-b53d1972a5f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b236377b33c3cd6f247539a4b34bddda55c6ff796e1744d45357dbeface14a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7e17cdf-44c7-4650-bae2-440ca5beefe1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "765a9617160b5f4c440056cce97aa81c0ea0d21b7a3e0abb54066a83cebe989d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Contracted Grands Prix ===\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.\n\n\n=== Returning additions (2008\u2013present) ===\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\n\nEuropean Grand Prix at Valencia Street Circuit (2008\u20132012)\nUnited States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (2012\u20132019, 2021\u2013present)\nAustrian Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring (2014\u2013present)\nMexican Grand Prix at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez (2015\u20132019); renamed Mexico City Grand Prix (2021\u2013present)\nEuropean Grand Prix at Baku City Circuit (2016; renamed the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for 2017\u20132019, 2021\u2013present)\nFrench Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard (2018\u20132019, 2021\u20132022)\nPortuguese Grand Prix at Algarve International Circuit (2020\u20132021)\nImola Circuit with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix (2020\u20132022, 2024\u2013present; previously hosted the Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix)\nDutch Grand Prix at Circuit Zandvoort (2021\u2013present)\n\n\n=== New Locations Initiative (2008\u2013present) ===\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\nSince 2008, the Formula One Group has been targeting new \"destination cities\" to expand its global reach, with the aim to produce races from countries that have not previously been involved in the sport. This initiative started with the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\n\n== Circuits ==\n\nFormula One races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks. The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations. In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\nA typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars. Special pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\". The Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA's minimum race distance requirement\u2014the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit, added in 2004 and designed \u2013 like most of F1's new circuits \u2013 by Hermann Tilke. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\nThe Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996. In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985.

The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 800 kg (1,800 lb) \u2013 the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.\nThe cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From 1998 to 2008, the tyres in Formula One were not \"slicks\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars. Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the 2009 season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis \u2013 one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their 2012 car. Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In 2022, McLaren (MCL36) and Red Bull Racing (RB18) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.\nCarbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for maximum performance and cooling.\nIn 2022, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence (commonly referred to as \"dirty air\") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the turbulent air. (See 2022 Formula One World Championship Technical regulations)\nFormula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction. As of 2022, the wheels are covered with \"spec\" (Standardised) Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the \"tyre profile\"), and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.\n\nStarting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units. These get a significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol. The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000 rpm and produced over 580 kW (780 bhp). For 2007, engines were restricted to 19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since the end of 2006.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58826, "end_char_idx": 63383, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41477d72-3d4c-4e24-8995-97ea623d9edc": {"__data__": {"id_": "41477d72-3d4c-4e24-8995-97ea623d9edc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7e17cdf-44c7-4650-bae2-440ca5beefe1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "765a9617160b5f4c440056cce97aa81c0ea0d21b7a3e0abb54066a83cebe989d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78fb8a10-e0ea-41d9-8969-8f420367c189", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c149375eba6fcd7786dff672738e671170c01de506212655153364841dee922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Starting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units.

For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000 rpm.\nA wide variety of technologies \u2013 including active suspension are banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h (220 mph) at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. During qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph). A BAR-Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.\nEven with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to \"drive on the ceiling\", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering. Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around 1g.\nAs of 2019, each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time. Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team. If more engines are used, they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used.

The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.\nCosts vary greatly from team to team. Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $200 million on engines in 2006, Renault spent approximately $125 million and Cosworth's 2006 V8 was developed for $15 million. In contrast to the 2006 season on which these figures are based, the 2007 sporting regulations banned all performance-related engine development.\nFormula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors' Championship. Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee, which in 2013 was \u20ac10,000 plus \u20ac1,000 per point.\nThere have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015, Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.\nThe cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as Albert Park, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as MotoGP. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300 million and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150 million to build.\nA number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing. The highest-paid driver in 2021 is Lewis Hamilton, who received $55 million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 \u2013 a record for any driver. The very top Formula One drivers get paid more than IndyCar or NASCAR drivers; however, the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F1 drivers, and the majority of NASCAR racers will make more money than their F1 counterparts. Most top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122 million and an income of $24 million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company grossed revenues of $620 million for the same quarter the previous year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 64993, "end_char_idx": 68761, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df2a6677-bd98-4bac-a7fb-234cf7611eae": {"__data__": {"id_": "df2a6677-bd98-4bac-a7fb-234cf7611eae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "78fb8a10-e0ea-41d9-8969-8f420367c189", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c149375eba6fcd7786dff672738e671170c01de506212655153364841dee922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae7becf9-ec03-4754-9366-8210401aca09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba6d0a5ea2bc435230c66ecdf8268a5cd8ba23ac49cd9ad5f14c541f1c4a51ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Cost cap ===\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport's governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.\nFor instance, in 2019, the richest teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari spent $420 million and $435 million respectively, whereas teams such as Williams or Haas, only spent $125 million and $150 million respectively. This gap was widening by the season and disparities like this prompted the FIA to introduce a cost cap in February 2021.\nThe FIA proposed the cost cap as a measure to reward engineering prowess over sheer expenditure. They did this in an effort to bridge the gap between the midfield teams and the teams challenging for the driver's and constructors' titles.\nThe cap was $175 million in 2021, although was reduced further to $145 million in response to economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2022, the cost cap was further reduced to $140 million and in 2023 it fell to $135 million where it will remain for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.\nThe 2022 season served as a critical test for the effectiveness of the cost cap as it was the year the new regulations were introduced, allowing all teams to start from scratch and build a car that was independent of the previous years. Critics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient to close the gap in competition because it excluded certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs along with loopholes that allowed the likes of Adrian Newey's salary of Red Bull to be excluded from the cost cap. They also contended that established teams could exploit existing infrastructures and resources accumulated over years, thus maintaining their competitive edge despite the spending limits.\nHowever, an alternative perspective highlights that the cost cap encourages teams to maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the 2023 season as the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points with Lando Norris at P17 and Oscar Piastri at P20. Seven months later, with the right upgrades, they managed to be the fastest car on the grid throughout qualifying and race pace. Facing budgetary constraints similar to their competitors, McLaren focused on strategic engineering upgrades and talent development. Their significant mid-season improvements led to notable on-track success, demonstrating that with clever resource management and engineering talent, teams can challenge the dominance of traditionally wealthier competitors.\nMcLaren CEO Zak Brown said that \"the cap has been outstanding for the sport.\" He also went on to say that there is a feeling that at any point in the season, any team can challenge for a place it wasn't equipped to do so at the start of the season.\nThe critics have expressed that the impact of the cost cap suggests that engineering excellence and strategic ingenuity can indeed offset the advantages of larger budgets. By promoting a more balanced competitive environment, the cost cap has made Formula 1 more exciting for fans and more viable for teams.\n\n\n== Future ==\n\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.\nFollowing their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in 2017, Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport's relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.\nOn 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement.

By 2025, all events should have become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.\nA report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the 2019 season, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and only 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: \"As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations. We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards.\"\nFrom the 2021\u201322 season, all cars increased the bio-component of their fuel, using E10 fuel, rather than the 5.75% of ethanol previously used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future. In December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability, to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.\n\n\n=== Social inequities ===\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative. The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\". The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport. The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007.\nIn addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport's cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white. Due to the results of the study, the team changed the car's livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 2025.\nThe 20 drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track. Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore \"End Racism\" shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities. In the year since, Lewis Hamilton has remained vocal in his pre-race attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.\n\n\n== Women in Formula One ==\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score.

The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019, 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.\n\n\n=== F1 Academy ===\nF1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garc\u00eda of Prema Racing. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport; Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.\n\n\n=== Female Formula One drivers ===\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first woman to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.\nLella Lombardi is the only woman to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races, and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, Lombardi became the first and only woman to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion half points were awarded and Lombardi only gained .5 points.\nDesir\u00e9 Wilson is the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the 1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship.\nGiovanna Amati was the last female driver to attempt to qualify for a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1992, she was signed by Brabham and participated in three races\u2014South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil\u2014but failed to qualify for any of them. Amati faced significant challenges, including an underperforming car and limited testing opportunities. She was replaced by Damon Hill after Brabham struggled with financial difficulties and performance issues. Despite not making a race start, her entry remains significant, as no woman has attempted to qualify for a Grand Prix since. Her participation also marked the last time a female driver was officially listed on an F1 entry list until Susie Wolff took part in free practice sessions for Williams in 2014.\n\n\n=== Race engineers ===\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing.\nBeginning in 2025, Laura M\u00fcller has served as the race engineer for Esteban Ocon at Haas, making her the first female to serve as a race engineer on a full time basis.\n\n\n=== Team principals ===\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing. In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\nAustrian Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first ever female Team principal when she took over the role at Sauber Formula 1 Team in 2010.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 76468, "end_char_idx": 80410, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0266441a-4f79-4e83-8b90-362b7bf86f46": {"__data__": {"id_": "0266441a-4f79-4e83-8b90-362b7bf86f46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d9c4147-7068-429e-b876-48b95d6e7bc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e003247ec375d2d415b50a8d550512243130b5c04fddde49ca112a487f98c68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38a33d0a-513d-466b-9854-5ec604d0594f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f34a009cd8923e4cfabd3dbb5cfcfdb0ef30d8af27915cce613d44dd41b63ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Team principals ===\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades.

The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race. The cumulative television audience for the 2001 season, which was broadcast to 200 territories, was calculated to be 54 billion.\nDuring the early 1990s, Formula One Group introduced updated branding, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website in an attempt to give the competition a corporate identity.\nAll broadcasters are provided with an identical world feed produced by Formula One Management (FOM), though for some races it was previously provided by local broadcasters. The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds \u2013 a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\nAn enhanced package called F1 Digital+ was launched by FOM in 1996, which included live broadcast of all sessions live as well as additional channels including onboard and pit-lane cameras. It was initially only offered in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, though it later became available in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The service was never financially viable and was discontinued at the end of the 2002 season.\nOn 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the HD format for the 2011 season.\nThe official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store since 2009, and on Google Play since 2011, that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary. On 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous \"flying one\" in use since 1993.\nIn March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary. In April 2024, FOM launched a free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States, which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 79594, "end_char_idx": 83050, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38a33d0a-513d-466b-9854-5ec604d0594f": {"__data__": {"id_": "38a33d0a-513d-466b-9854-5ec604d0594f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0266441a-4f79-4e83-8b90-362b7bf86f46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31c3c8ad869937188a3529b9839c576f9f88cc3111560f0d8f46bc77d2cf87b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "26d95120-cd65-4958-8d14-56e1de45ece8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14e2603c90768025b74b5d2113b9ea772b9fadb942646566ff137bfca2d3f2d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Television broadcasters ===\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 from 2012 to 2018. Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1 which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows. In 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season. The BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season, three years earlier than planned. The free-to-air TV rights were picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season. Sky Sports F1 coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra coverage was extended until 2021. As of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until 2024.\nIn south-east Asia, the middle east and north Africa, Formula One is broadcast by beIN Sports. In India, sessions are broadcast by streaming service FanCode and satellite television provider Tata Play. In China, the rights are held by Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV.\nIn the United States, ESPN has held the rights since 2013, carrying the broadcast and commentary feed provided by Sky Sports UK. Some races are also broadcast free-to-air on ABC under the ESPN on ABC banner. According to The Athletic, the fee paid by ESPN is estimated at $90 million per year as of 2025, with the current deal set to expire after the 2025 season.\nIn Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the exclusive rights are held by pay TV broadcaster Sky Sport. The rights were previously shared with free-to-air channel RTL for many years, which had broadcast all Formula One qualifying and racing sessions since 1991, but lost its rights after the 2020 season due to being outbid by Sky Sport. Despite no longer holding the rights themselves, RTL has broadcast selected sessions on free-to-air television and its streaming service RTL+ as part of various sublicensing agreements with Sky Sport.\nIn France, Formula One is currently broadcast by pay TV channel Canal+, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.\n\n\n== Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races ==\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous. Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations. However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\n\nThe first Formula One race was held in 1946, whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship; in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the 1983 Race of Champions.\nThe World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\nThe World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e. without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 race counted towards the World Championship. This race was run to American Automobile Association, and later United States Automobile Club, Championship Car regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, Alberto Ascari in 1952, started at Indianapolis during this period.\nFrom 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations. Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the List of Formula One drivers, Clemente Biondetti is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950, but only one of these counted for the World Championship.\nIn the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 83053, "end_char_idx": 87739, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26d95120-cd65-4958-8d14-56e1de45ece8": {"__data__": {"id_": "26d95120-cd65-4958-8d14-56e1de45ece8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b265f5f3f522141d47171f89b8bd947bac52324769aff429220db779c4fd56a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "38a33d0a-513d-466b-9854-5ec604d0594f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f34a009cd8923e4cfabd3dbb5cfcfdb0ef30d8af27915cce613d44dd41b63ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== European non-championship racing ===\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in 1950 a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the Race of Champions, Oulton Park International Gold Cup and the International Trophy, were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid. These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.\n\n\n=== South African Formula One championship ===\n\nSouth Africa's domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there were also locally built or modified cars.\n\n\n=== British Formula One Championship ===\n\nThe DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980, the series saw South African Desir\u00e9 Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFormula One video games\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n Media related to Formula One at Wikimedia Commons", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 87742, "end_char_idx": 90228, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33ddeceb-0775-4af0-8abc-97dd3db1425d": {"__data__": {"id_": "33ddeceb-0775-4af0-8abc-97dd3db1425d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd8b9f0c-345c-4609-b68b-a651c01179e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcd42efa11514fac46f5d352670843b50c8c25bb39021f3c82669f57a5eb3572", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Formula One race weekend refers to an auto racing event which takes place over three days (usually Friday to Sunday), with a series of practice and qualifying sessions prior to the race on Sunday. Current regulations provide for two free practice sessions on Friday, a morning practice session and an afternoon qualifying session held on Saturday, and the race held on Sunday afternoon or evening, although the structure of the weekend has changed numerous times over the history of the sport. Historically, the Monaco Grand Prix held practice on Thursday rather than Friday (up to and including 2021), and the whole schedule for the Las Vegas (starting from its inaugural event in 2023), Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix (in 2024 only) is brought forward by one day. At most Formula One race weekends, other events such as races in other F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) series, such as Formula 2 or Formula 3, are held.\n\n\n== Free practice ==\n\nSince 2006, three free practice sessions (often abbreviated to FP1, FP2, and FP3) are held before the race. The first is typically held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon, while the third session is typically on Saturday morning. From 2021, all sessions last for one hour; prior to this, the Friday sessions were 90 minutes in length and the Saturday session was one hour in length. In addition in 2021, cars are now put under parc ferm\u00e9 conditions after the third practice session instead of qualifying. Private tests are now heavily restricted, but a third driver (such as a reserve, test, or junior driver) is permitted to take part in the first Friday free practice session in the place of a regular driver. The second practice session for the Bahrain, Singapore and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix takes place in the evening, as these races are run at night. All practice sessions for the Las Vegas Grand Prix were held at night, with the first two on Thursday, the third and qualifying on Friday and the race held on Saturday.\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\n\nA qualifying session is held before each race to determine the order cars will be lined up in at the start of the race, with the fastest qualifier starting at the front and the slowest at the back. Drivers who could not set a time for any reason are also relegated to the back.\n\n\n=== Historical methods ===\nTraditionally before 1996, qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday (Thursday at Monaco) afternoon from 13:00 to 14:00 local time, with the second held on Saturday afternoon at the same time. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards their final grid position. Each driver was limited to twelve laps per qualifying session.\nIn 1996, qualifying was amended with the Friday qualifying session abolished in a favour for a single qualifying session held on Saturday afternoon. As previously, each driver was limited to twelve laps with the inclusion of a 107% rule to exclude drivers with slow lap times. This was calculated by using the time of the driver on pole position and adding on 7% to create a cut-off time. This format remained until the conclusion of the 2002 season. Between 2003 and 2005, the qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Friday and Saturday afternoon with the cars running one at a time. In 2003, the Friday running order was determined with the leader of the Drivers' Championship heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. No refuelling was allowed between the start of Saturday qualifying and the start of the race, so drivers qualified on race fuel. The lap times from the Friday afternoon session did not determine the grid order.\nIn 2004, the Friday session was moved to Saturday. The running order for the first session was now based on the result of the previous race. At first both sessions were held back-to-back, but the first session was later moved earlier in the day. At the start of 2005, the sessions were held on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Lap times from both sessions were counted to give the overall aggregate position. From the 2005 European Grand Prix onwards, the Sunday morning session was dropped for a single run on Saturday afternoon having proved unpopular with drivers, teams and broadcasters. The running order was the reverse of the previous race result.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4470, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd8b9f0c-345c-4609-b68b-a651c01179e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd8b9f0c-345c-4609-b68b-a651c01179e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "33ddeceb-0775-4af0-8abc-97dd3db1425d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66b956c5176570f97a7f884483936fde62298fb80cd7dceb9988095ac8aed87b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "adbacb15-ed55-4967-8028-0d515b0d4931", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d7e957f733d114677318dc14da7c0d9c4feca68374c18710898773b61efc953", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Current format ===\nSince 2006, qualifying takes place on Saturday afternoon in a three-stage \"knockout\" system. One hour is dedicated to determining the grid order, divided into three periods with short intermissions between them. Since 2010, the first qualifying period (Q1) is eighteen minutes long, with all twenty cars competing. At the end of Q1, the five slowest drivers are eliminated from further qualification rounds, and fill positions sixteen to twenty on the grid based on their fastest lap time. Any driver attempting to set a qualifying time when the period ends is permitted to finish their lap, though no new laps may be started once the chequered flag is shown. After a short break, the second period (Q2) (15 minutes long) begins, with fifteen cars on the circuit. At the end of Q2, the five slowest drivers are once again eliminated, filling grid positions eleven to fifteen. Finally, the third qualifying period (Q3) (12 minutes long) features the ten fastest drivers from the second period. The drivers are issued a new set of soft tyres and have twelve minutes to set a qualifying time, which will determine the top ten positions on the grid. The driver who sets the fastest qualifying time is said to be on pole position, the grid position that offers the best physical position from which to start the race.\nDrivers may complete as many laps as they choose within the permitted qualifying session's time. As of the 2022 season, all drivers are permitted to start the race on the tyre of their choice regardless of their grid position, whereas previously it was required for the drivers starting in the top 10 grid positions to start on the same tyre as the one that they set their fastest lap time within the second qualifying session. Generally, a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track in order to get to the start/finish line (the out-lap). Having crossed the line, they will attempt to achieve the quickest time around the circuit that they can in one or more laps (the flying lap or hot lap). This is the lap time which is used in calculating grid position. Finally, the driver will continue back around the track and re-enter the pit lane (the in-lap); however, this is merely strategy, and no teams are obliged by the rules to follow this formula, as drivers may elect to set several flying laps before returning to the pits. For the first two races of the 2016 season, a modified format was used where drivers were eliminated during the sessions rather than just at the end and only eight drivers progressed to the final session. Qualifying reverted to the previous format from the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix onwards.\n\n\n==== Sprint qualifying ====\nFollowing the decision to make sprints standalone from 2023 onwards, sprints were given a dedicated qualifying session, dubbed in 2023 \"sprint shootout\" and \"sprint qualifying\" in 2024. The format of sprint shootout is the same as qualifying, but with the three segments (dubbed \"SQ1\", \"SQ2\" and \"SQ3\" instead of \"Q1\", \"Q2\" and \"Q3\") being shorter at 12 minutes, 10 minutes and 8 minutes, instead of 18, 15 and 12 minutes. Initially, new tyres were mandatory for each phase, with mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3. This was changed for the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix to allow teams the ability to use any set of soft tyres, be it new or used, for SQ3, after Lando Norris could not run in SQ3 at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, after exhausting his allocation of soft tyres.\n\n\n=== Qualifying requirements ===\nAs of 2025, ten teams are entered for the Formula One World Championship, each entering two cars for a total of twenty cars. The regulations place a limit of twenty-six entries for the championship. At some periods in the history of Formula One the number of cars entered for each race has exceeded the number permitted, which historically would vary from race to race according to the circuit used; Monaco, for example, for many years allowed only twenty cars to compete because of the restricted space available. The slowest cars excess to the circuit limit would not qualify for the race and would be listed as 'Did not qualify' (DNQ) in race results.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4473, "end_char_idx": 8638, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adbacb15-ed55-4967-8028-0d515b0d4931": {"__data__": {"id_": "adbacb15-ed55-4967-8028-0d515b0d4931", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd8b9f0c-345c-4609-b68b-a651c01179e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcd42efa11514fac46f5d352670843b50c8c25bb39021f3c82669f57a5eb3572", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91e59adf-69a6-47ad-80f7-a7de3f158f5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "925ddd191c982d89de6e152ddb7f3c83210b4191c34d43f3ed5417557ccfca68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Qualifying requirements ===\nAs of 2025, ten teams are entered for the Formula One World Championship, each entering two cars for a total of twenty cars.

The slowest cars excess to the circuit limit would not qualify for the race and would be listed as 'Did not qualify' (DNQ) in race results.\n\n\n==== Historical pre-qualifying ====\nThere had been pre-qualifying sessions in the late 1970s, but during the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as thirty-nine for some races. Because of the dangers of having so many cars on the track at the same time, pre-qualifying sessions were re-introduced for the teams with the worst record over the previous twelve months, including any new teams. Usually, only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed into the qualifying session proper, where thirty cars competed for twenty-six places on the starting grid for the race. The slowest cars from the pre-qualifying session were listed in race results as 'Did Not Pre-Qualify' (DNPQ). Pre-qualifying was discontinued after the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix when many small teams withdrew from the sport.\n\n\n==== 107% rule ====\n\nAs the number of cars entered in the world championship fell below twenty-six, a situation arose in which any car entered would automatically qualify for the race, no matter how slowly it had been driven. The 107% rule was introduced in 1996 to prevent completely uncompetitive cars being entered in the championship. If a car's qualifying time was not within 107% of the pole sitter's time, that car would not qualify for the race, unless at the discretion of the race stewards for a situation such as a rain-affected qualifying session. For example, if the pole-sitter's time was one minute and forty seconds, any car eligible for racing had to set a time within one minute and forty-seven seconds.\nThe 107% rule was removed in 2003 since the FIA's rules indicated previously that 24 cars could take the start of a Formula One race, and a minimum of twenty cars had to enter a race. In 2003, the qualifying procedure changed to a single-lap system, rendering the rule inoperable. However, there were concerns about the pace of the new teams in the 2010 season. As the qualifying procedure had been changed since the 2006 season to a three-part knockout system, the rule could now be reintroduced. As such, the 107% rule was reintroduced in the 2011 Formula One season. Currently, cars eliminated in Q1 have to be within 107% of the fastest Q1 time in order to qualify for the race.\nSince the rule was re-introduced, only twice have cars failed to qualify for a Grand Prix \u2013 both times involving Hispania Racing cars and both times occurring at the Australian Grand Prix, namely in 2011 (Vitantonio Liuzzi and Narain Karthikeyan) and 2012 (Karthikeyan and Pedro de la Rosa). At their discretion, stewards may permit a driver who fails to set a qualifying time within the desired 107% span to enter the race; for example, at the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lance Stroll and Brendon Hartley both failed to set times within 107%, but were permitted to race on the grounds of satisfactory lap times in free practice. After eleven drivers failed to set satisfactory Q1 times at the 2016 Hungarian Grand Prix due to inclement weather, the regulations were amended in 2018 so that wet sessions were not subject to the 107% rule.\n\n\n=== Grid penalties ===\nDrivers or cars may be issued penalties against their starting positions, commonly for exceeding component limits, or sporting offences in free practice, qualifying, or a previous race.

This can lead to the starting grid being significantly different from the qualifying order.\n\n\n== Sprint ==\n\nDuring the 2021 Formula One World Championship, Formula One trialed a \"sprint qualifying\" system at three Grands Prix\u2014Great Britain, Italy, and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2014in which the grid for the race on Sunday was determined by a 100 km sprint on Saturday. On a race weekend with sprint qualifying, the sessions on Friday, instead of regular two practice sessions, consisted of one practice session and a traditional qualifying session, which was limited to soft tyres and which set the grid for sprint qualifying. Only the winner of the sprint qualifying was considered to have taken pole position for the main Grand Prix, and they received a trophy similar to the pole position trophy awarded at other race weekends. The top three finishers in sprint qualifying in 2021 received World Championship points in a 3\u20132\u20131 scoring system. Formula One stuck with having sprints at three events, after initially planning to increase it to six events. These plans were abandoned after teams failed to agree on the cost-cap considerations for additional sprint events.\nFor 2022 season, \"sprint qualifying\" was renamed to \"sprint\". The weekend format remained unchanged from 2021 and was run at the Emilia Romagna, Austrian, and S\u00e3o Paulo Grands Prix with points now awarded to the top eight finishers rather than the top three finishers as was the case in 2021. Unlike the 2021 season, the driver who set the fastest time in qualifying was credited as the official pole-sitter (unless penalised), with the winner of the sprint continuing to have the right to start the main race from the first-place grid position.\nFrom 2023, standalone sprint events were implemented, meaning that the outcome of the sprint race would no longer set the grid for the main race. These plans were approved a few days before the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix \u2013 the first of the six events on the 2023 calendar to feature the sprint format. The format for sprint events in 2023 featured Friday consisting of a single practice session followed by the qualifying session which set the starting grid for the main race on Sunday; while Saturday featured a special qualifying session, named the sprint shootout, which set the grid for the sprint race (called the \"sprint\") which was also held later on Saturday. The structure of the sprint weekends was changed again  for 2024, with the goal of rationalising sprint events and separating them from the rest of the Grand Prix weekend. The sprint shootout, which sets the starting grid order for the sprint race, was moved to Friday afternoon after the weekend's only practice session. The sprint shootout was also renamed sprint qualifying. The sprint will then be the first session to take place on Saturday, followed by qualifying for the main race. The Grand Prix itself remains on Sunday. For the first three seasons of the sprint format, there was a single parc ferm\u00e9 period starting from Friday's Grand Prix qualifying session all the way through to the start of the Grand Prix. However, for 2024, there are two separate parc ferm\u00e9 periods: the first lasts from the start of sprint qualifying to the start of the Sprint and the second lasts from Saturday's Grand Prix qualifying to the start of the Grand Prix itself. This is intended to allow teams to fine tune their cars between the end of the sprint and the start of Grand Prix qualifying.\n\n\n== Race ==\n\nThe race itself is held on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of night races at Singapore, Bahrain, Qatar, Las Vegas, and Saudi Arabia and a day/night race for the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The Las Vegas Grand Prix was held on a Saturday, with the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix provisioned to move to a Saturday in 2024; prior to that, the last race not to take place on a Sunday was the 1985 South African Grand Prix, which took place on a Saturday.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11745, "end_char_idx": 15884, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6dbb9a1-e8dd-4c8f-80b9-e563e1d7b6f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6dbb9a1-e8dd-4c8f-80b9-e563e1d7b6f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "91e59adf-69a6-47ad-80f7-a7de3f158f5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "925ddd191c982d89de6e152ddb7f3c83210b4191c34d43f3ed5417557ccfca68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11d57b1e-7fe3-4e87-9b2f-adf3cda7db5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7783d1ddd49aafc819d3a614bef12202c1cb8a8af8aa9ea78df7b3442cc1d593", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Race ==\n\nThe race itself is held on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of night races at Singapore, Bahrain, Qatar, Las Vegas, and Saudi Arabia and a day/night race for the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

At the hour of the race, a green light signifies the beginning of the relatively slow formation lap during which all cars parade around the course doing a final tyre warmup and system checks. The cars then return to their assigned grid spot for the standing race start. The starting light system, which consists of five pairs of lights mounted above the start/finish line, then lights up each pair at one-second intervals. Once all five pairs are illuminated, after a random length of time between 0.2 and 3 seconds, the red lights are turned off by the race director, at which point the race starts. The race length is defined as the smallest number of complete laps that exceeds 305 kilometres (the Monaco Grand Prix is the sole exception with a race length of 78 laps / 260.5 km), though occasionally some races are truncated due to special circumstances. The race can not exceed two hours in length\u2014if this interval is reached, the race will be ended at the end of the next full lap\u2014unless the race is halted by a red flag, in which case the total time including the red flag stoppage must not exceed three hours, and the total time excluding the red flag stoppage may not exceed two hours. At the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, the three hour countdown was stopped with force majeure being cited.\n\n\n=== Pit stops ===\n\nEach driver is also required to use two different types of dry compound during a dry race, and so must make a mandatory pit stop. Timing pit stops with reference to other cars is crucial\u2014if they are following another car but are unable to pass, the driver may try to stay on the track as long as possible, or pit immediately, as newer tyres are usually faster. Prior to the 2010 season, drivers used to make pit stops for fuel more than once during a race, as the cars on average traveled two kilometres per litre (approximately five miles per gallon). Nowadays this figure is higher, due to changes in engines from 2014, and as a result refuelling has been forbidden during a race since 2010. If a driver starts the race using intermediate or wet tyres, they are not mandated to make a pit stop.\n\n\n=== Podium ceremony ===\nAt the end of the race, the first, second and third-placed drivers take their places on a podium, where they stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of their team is played. Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers and a constructor's trophy to a representative from the winner's team, and the winning drivers spray champagne and are interviewed. The three drivers then go to a media room for a press conference where they answer questions in English and their native languages.\n\n\n== Points system ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15410, "end_char_idx": 18888, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11d57b1e-7fe3-4e87-9b2f-adf3cda7db5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "11d57b1e-7fe3-4e87-9b2f-adf3cda7db5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6dbb9a1-e8dd-4c8f-80b9-e563e1d7b6f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e334b2a6a86034ea46ea167b0f3362f801c098547f2f8be71dc963c392b53405", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Podium ceremony ===\nAt the end of the race, the first, second and third-placed drivers take their places on a podium, where they stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of their team is played.

In 1961, the scoring was revised to give the winner nine points instead of eight, and the single point awarded for fastest lap was given for sixth place for the first time the previous year. In 1991, the points system was again revised to give the victor 10 points, with all other scorers recording the same 6\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 result. In 2003, the FIA further revised the scoring system to apportion points to the first eight classified finishers (a classified finisher must complete 90% of race distance) on a 10\u20138\u20136\u20135\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 basis.\nAt certain points between 1950 and 1990, drivers' points for the season would be tallied based on their best results across the World Championship, which varied from 4 to 11 in a season, and during the late 1960s and 1970s points would be tallied based on their best results from each half of the season, which varied from four to seven. This was done in order to equalise the footings of teams which may not have had the wherewithal to compete in all events. With the advent of the Concorde Agreements, this practice has been discontinued, though it did feature prominently in several world championships through the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in 1988 when Alain Prost scored a total of 105 points to Ayrton Senna's 94, but due to only the best 11 results counting towards the World Championship, Senna won, with the final points tally being 90\u201387.\n\n\n=== Current system ===\n\nPoints are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in a race. The winner receives 25 points, the second-place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10, respectively. In a dead heat, prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie.:\u200aArt 7.1\u200a The winner of the annual championship is the driver (or team, for the Constructors' Championship) with the most points. If the number of points is the same, priority is given to the driver with more wins.

Verstappen has won four Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2021 to 2024 with Red Bull, and has won 65 Grands Prix across 11 seasons.\nBorn in Hasselt and raised in Maaseik, Verstappen is the son of Dutch former Formula One driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian former kart racer Sophie Kumpen. After a successful karting career\u2014culminating in his record-breaking 2013 season\u2014Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. Progressing directly to FIA European Formula 3, Verstappen broke several records on his way to third in the championship in his rookie season with Van Amersfoort. Aged 17, Verstappen signed for Toro Rosso in 2015 as part of the Red Bull Junior Team, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history at the Australian Grand Prix. Following several points finishes in his debut season, Verstappen retained his seat for 2016 before being promoted to parent team Red Bull after four rounds. On debut for Red Bull, aged 18, Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest-ever driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. Verstappen achieved multiple race wins in his 2017 and 2018 campaigns, before finishing third in both the 2019 and 2020 World Drivers' Championships under Honda power.\nVerstappen won his maiden title in 2021 after overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the last race of the season, becoming the first World Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands. Verstappen won the next two championships in 2022 and 2023, overturning the largest points deficit in Formula One history in the former and breaking numerous records across both seasons. He secured his fourth consecutive title in 2024 after winning nine Grands Prix, including a widely acclaimed wet-weather performance in S\u00e3o Paulo, to become the first driver to win the championship driving for a third-placed constructor in 41 years.\nAs of the 2025 Canadian Grand Prix, Verstappen has achieved 65 race wins, 43 pole positions, 34 fastest laps and 117 podiums in Formula One. In addition to being the youngest Grand Prix winner, he holds several Formula One records, including the most wins in a season (19), the most podium finishes in a season (21), the most consecutive wins (10), and the most consecutive pole positions (8, shared with Ayrton Senna). Verstappen is contracted to remain at Red Bull until at least the end of the 2028 season. Verstappen was listed in the 2024 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 2022.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMax Emilian Verstappen was born on 30 September 1997 in Hasselt, Belgium to Jos Verstappen and Sophie Kumpen. Verstappen's parents separated when he was young, after which he lived with his father. His younger sister, Victoria, lived with their mother. Verstappen has three younger half-siblings from his father: a sister from Jos's second marriage and a brother and sister from Jos's current marriage.\nHis family has a long association with motor sports: his father is a Dutch former Formula One driver, his Belgian mother competed in karting, and his first cousin once removed, Anthony Kumpen, competed in endurance racing and is a two-time NASCAR Whelen Euro Series champion currently serving as the team manager for PK Carsport in Euro Series. Verstappen initially attended a secondary school in Maaseik, before moving into private tutoring; he admitted that he used to leave class early to attend races across Europe with his father.\n\n\n== Junior racing career ==\n\n\n=== Karting ===", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3755, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb584ec3-8c29-467a-89ac-7588aa9d2f5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb584ec3-8c29-467a-89ac-7588aa9d2f5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a310c76-7933-4fe4-87dd-7cdd89b25e46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "306f38a3064d216785bc91e90d591288d60909f1bda3432c94dc8035b1f11c27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "caec08a3-d42e-4265-872d-122864171bde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bab74399ed333499877d7e12404d8f509c0b331ddcecf6515eadfd28a9104a77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Junior racing career ==\n\n\n=== Karting ===\n\n\n==== 2005\u20132009: Dominance in national championships ====\nVerstappen started racing in karts at the age of four and competing in championships at the age of seven. In 2005 he competed in the Mini Junior championship of his home province of Limburg, Belgium and won the VAS Championship in the same category. In 2006, he repeated his success. In 2007, Verstappen graduated to the Rotax Max Mini Max class and won the Rotax Max Challenge Belgium and the Dutch Championship in that category. In 2008, racing in a CRG kart entered by his father, Verstappen won the Belgian Cadet Championship, as well as the Rotax Max Challenge Belgium and Benelux Karting Series in Mini Max class. In 2009, Verstappen joined Pex Racing, a CRG customer team. That year, he defended his titles in the Mini Max championships and won the Belgian KF5 Championship.\n\n\n==== 2010\u20132012: Entering the international karting scene ====\nVerstappen was signed by CRG to race in their factory team and stepped up to international karting in 2010. At the KF3 World Cup, Verstappen finished second to the more experienced Alexander Albon (who would eventually become his Formula One teammate at Red Bull Racing) but beat him at the WSK Euro Series  and also won the WSK World Series, beating Robert Vi\u0219oiu. He finished fifth in the European Championship and won the WSK Nations Cup as well as the final of the Bridgestone Cup where during a 28 laps' race in the rain he beat Dennis Olsen by over 11 seconds. In 2011, Verstappen won the WSK Euro Series ahead of Esteban Ocon in a Parilla-powered CRG kart. However, it was not a successful year for him, as he finished 14th in the European Championship and got taken out in the World Cup by Charles Leclerc.\nIn the following year, Verstappen joined the Intrepid Driver Program to race in the KF2 and KZ2 classes. He won the WSK Master Series in the KF2 class, beating the CRG driver Felice Tiene. Verstappen won the South Garda Winter Cup in the KF2 class, beating Dennis Olsen and Antonio Fuoco. He finished sixth in the WSK Euro Series. He was the youngest driver taking part in the World Championship in KF1 class and finished eight.\nIn July 2012, it was announced that Verstappen would leave Intrepid. After a short stint with CRG-built Zanardi karts, Verstappen returned to the factory CRG team. He finished second at the World Cup in the KF2 class and competed at the SKUSA SuperNationals in the KZ2 class in a CRG, finishing 21st.\n\n\n==== 2013: Record-breaking season ====\n\nIn 2013, Verstappen completed a record-breaking season in karting, having progressed to the senior KF and KZ categories. Aged 15, he won three CIK-FIA championships in a single season: two European Championships and a World Championship; an unprecedented feat in the history of the discipline. He became the first driver since his father Jos to win two European Championships in the same season, and the first to do so in both the primary direct-drive and gearbox classes. By winning the 2013 KZ World Championship at Varennes-sur-Allier, beating Charles Leclerc to the title, Verstappen became the youngest-ever driver to win the gearbox World Championship.\nFurther adding to his accolades in 2013, Verstappen also finished third at the KF World Championship after being disqualified for a move on Nicklas Nielsen in the final race, having won the opening round and pre-final. This was the only championship he failed to win in 2013 whilst completing all rounds. Verstappen won the South Garda Winter Cup in KF2, as well as the WSK Euro Series and the WSK Super Master Series in KZ1 and KZ2, respectively.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3711, "end_char_idx": 7354, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caec08a3-d42e-4265-872d-122864171bde": {"__data__": {"id_": "caec08a3-d42e-4265-872d-122864171bde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb584ec3-8c29-467a-89ac-7588aa9d2f5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9733c9009bac7887370a87f9e902786d08bb203777e3cfc2dcae8631176489e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "deeb4b20-c4b8-4c3e-b18d-57b938523796", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ca52bdaab9ffeef60da58f0906137687530556af5808a9fda31e24bc9153a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Lower formulae ===\n\nVerstappen first experienced formula racing at Pembrey in August 2013 with Manor MP; he drove 160 laps across two days in a Barazi-Epsilon FR2.0-10. He tested for several other Formula Renault 2.0 teams that year. In December 2013, Verstappen tested a Dallara F311 Formula Three car run by Motopark Academy. An additional Formula Renault test followed in December at Circuito de Jerez. Driving for Josef Kaufmann Racing, Verstappen went faster than Formula Renault regulars like Steijn Schothorst and Matt Parry. At the Circuit Ricardo Tormo near Valencia, Verstappen set a faster lap time than the more experienced driver Eddie Cheever III.\n\n\n==== 2014: Florida Winter Series and Formula Three ====\nOn 16 January 2014, it was announced Verstappen would make his racing debut in the non-championship Florida Winter Series. On 5 February, at the second race weekend, Verstappen won the race at Palm Beach International Raceway after he started from pole. A few weeks later, Verstappen won his second race of the series at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway after beating Nicholas Latifi by 0.004 seconds.\nFollowing his single-seater debut in the inaugural Florida Winter Series, Verstappen drove in the 2014 FIA Formula 3 European Championship for Van Amersfoort Racing. Aged 16, Verstappen achieved 10 victories in total\u2014including a record six consecutive wins at Spa-Francorchamps and the Norisring\u2014along with eight retirements and one missed start, becoming the youngest race winner and polesitter in Formula Three history at the Hockenheimring; he placed third in the overall standings, with the most wins.\n\n\n== Formula One career ==\nDuring the first practice session at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, Verstappen replaced Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in the 2015 season. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend. In August 2014, Verstappen joined the Red Bull Junior Team after testing a Formula Renault 3.5 car. He also considered an offer from Mercedes to join their driver development programme.\n\n\n=== Toro Rosso (2015\u20132016) ===\n\nVerstappen then became the youngest driver to start a World Championship race through joining Toro Rosso's race drivers' line-up with Carlos Sainz as his teammate, in his Grand Prix debut as a full-time driver at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix at the age of 17 years, 166 days\u2014breaking Jaime Alguersuari's existing record by almost two years. In this first race, Verstappen ran in points-scoring positions until he was forced to retire due to an engine failure. However, at the subsequent race in Malaysia, Verstappen qualified sixth and finished the race in seventh place, scoring his first Formula One points aged 17 years, 180 days, breaking the record of the then-youngest driver to score World Championship points.\nAt the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision with Romain Grosjean, after clipping the back of Grosjean's Lotus on the approach to the tight first corner, Sainte Devote, and crashed into the barriers at high speed. Verstappen was given a five-place grid penalty for causing the accident, and was branded \"dangerous\" by Williams driver Felipe Massa.\nVerstappen continued to regularly finish in the points as well as achieving his best finish of the 2015 season in Hungary by finishing fourth, and equalled this result at the United States Grand Prix. At the end of the season, Verstappen received three awards at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony, for \"Rookie of the Year\", \"Personality of the Year\" and \"Action of the Year\", for his overtake on Felipe Nasr on the outside of the Blanchimont corner at the Belgian Grand Prix.\n\nVerstappen began the 2016 season at Toro Rosso, again alongside Sainz. Verstappen qualified fifth for the opening race of the season in Australia, but during the race made several radio calls to his team due to frustration at being behind Sainz on track before Verstappen's Toro Rosso came into contact with his teammate's car whilst attempting to pass him with three laps to go, and he eventually finished tenth. Verstappen enjoyed a more successful weekend at the following race in Bahrain, finishing sixth to score Toro Rosso's first-ever points at the Sakhir circuit.\n\n\n=== Red Bull (2016\u2013present) ===", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7357, "end_char_idx": 11718, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "deeb4b20-c4b8-4c3e-b18d-57b938523796": {"__data__": {"id_": "deeb4b20-c4b8-4c3e-b18d-57b938523796", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "caec08a3-d42e-4265-872d-122864171bde", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bab74399ed333499877d7e12404d8f509c0b331ddcecf6515eadfd28a9104a77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e6f5be2-8c81-41f1-9671-9a4c48c01fa9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d86a70500d658f0cf92c2f4a98adebd94b2a7820c8b35e865e8bf223a4a5ee29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Red Bull (2016\u2013present) ===\n\n\n==== 2016: Youngest Grand Prix winner ====\n\nOn 5 May 2016, following the Russian Grand Prix, Red Bull Racing announced that Verstappen would be replacing Daniil Kvyat from the Spanish Grand Prix onwards, with Kvyat returning to Toro Rosso. According to Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner, \"Max has proven to be an outstanding young talent. His performance at Toro Rosso has been impressive so far and we are pleased to give him the opportunity to drive for Red Bull Racing.\" After qualifying fourth for the Spanish Grand Prix, Verstappen rose to second behind teammate Daniel Ricciardo on the opening lap after Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out of the race. Verstappen took the race lead as he was placed on a two-stop rather than the same three-stop strategy as Ricciardo, and he held off Ferrari's Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in the later stages of the race to take his first Formula One victory. By doing so he displaced Sebastian Vettel as the youngest driver ever to win a Formula One Grand Prix at the age of 18 years and 228 days.\nIn his first eight races with Red Bull, he achieved six top-five finishes, including four podiums.\nDuring the Belgian Grand Prix, Verstappen collided with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen at the first corner, pushed Vettel, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and P\u00e9rez wide at Les Combes, and aggressively blocked R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen on the Kemmel straight. Verstappen was criticised for his driving, with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen saying that he was \"going to cause a huge accident sooner or later.\" Christian Horner noted that the driving was \"on the edge\", and that Verstappen will \"look at it and learn for future races.\" In September, Formula One director Charlie Whiting called in Verstappen for a discussion, and later gave him a 'gentle warning' due to his aggressive driving. However, in October, drivers' concerns about Verstappen's defensive tactics led the FIA to disallow moving under braking.\nAt the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified fourth. In a rain affected race, he almost hit the barrier after he slid on the main straight due to a loss of traction, causing oversteer. After an additional tyre change from intermediates back to rain tyres, he ran in 16th place with just 15 laps remaining. Verstappen then made several overtakes in quick succession during the closing laps to eventually finish on the podium in third place. He received considerable praise for his performance: rival team Mercedes' team principal, Toto Wolff, labelled it \"The Verstappen Show\", and described Verstappen's drive as \"physics..being redefined\". However, Verstappen came under criticism from four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who stated that Verstappen had pushed him off the track at the Jun\u00e7\u00e3o corner late in the race. The race stewards did not share Vettel's view and decided that no reprimand was warranted.\n\n\n==== 2017\u20132018: Reliability issues and rise to prominence ====\n\nDuring the first 14 races of the 2017 season, Verstappen suffered seven retirements, four due to mechanical issues, and three due to first lap collisions in Spain, Austria and Singapore. Of the races he finished, however, he claimed a third place in China, and in another five races he finished fourth or fifth.\nFrom the Malaysian Grand Prix onward, Verstappen enjoyed a surge of success. He won his second Formula One race at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix, a day after his 20th birthday, passing then three-time champion Lewis Hamilton for the lead in the early stages of the race. He finished second in the following race in Japan. He then finished third at the United States Grand Prix, but was classified fourth after his final lap overtake on Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was deemed illegal. He won his third Formula One race at the Mexican Grand Prix, after passing Sebastian Vettel on the opening lap.\n\nIn the first six races of the 2018 season, Verstappen had been involved in at least one incident in each race. In Australia, he qualified fourth but fell behind Kevin Magnussen at the start. In his attempts to retake the position he ran wide multiple times and damaged his car, with a spin causing him to fall further down the order. He recovered to eventually finish the race in sixth place. At the next race in Bahrain, he crashed during qualifying and started in 15th place. He had a productive first lap after which he found himself in the points while challenging Lewis Hamilton.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11687, "end_char_idx": 16086, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e6f5be2-8c81-41f1-9671-9a4c48c01fa9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e6f5be2-8c81-41f1-9671-9a4c48c01fa9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "deeb4b20-c4b8-4c3e-b18d-57b938523796", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ca52bdaab9ffeef60da58f0906137687530556af5808a9fda31e24bc9153a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db1d71f2-1a29-47bc-aa5e-6158feefd49c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fee3add5f83efbfd07514d2f85760416393cb12fa5fae17b518b17203a5d4d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "He finished second in the following race in Japan.

He had a productive first lap after which he found himself in the points while challenging Lewis Hamilton. He attempted an overtake on the reigning World Champion at the start of lap two, but collided with the Mercedes driver and suffered a puncture that ultimately led to suspension damage, forcing him out of the race.\nAt the next race in China, Verstappen qualified fifth and had moved up to third at the end of the first lap. Both Red Bull drivers pitted for fresh tyres during a safety car which left them with a tyre advantage over the front-runners ahead. In an overtake attempt on Sebastian Vettel for third place, Verstappen collided with the championship leader, causing him to fall to eighth and receive a 10-second penalty. He recovered to fourth place, with his penalty causing him to be classified fifth. Teammate Ricciardo went on to win the race. In Azerbaijan, Verstappen was embroiled in a race-long battle with Ricciardo for fourth place. After numerous position changes between the two teammates during the race, Ricciardo ran into the back of Verstappen during an overtake attempt from which the Dutchman aggressively defended, causing the retirement of both cars. Both drivers were blamed by the team and reprimanded by the stewards. Verstappen bounced back in Spain with his first podium of the season by finishing third behind the Mercedes drivers, holding off Sebastian Vettel. However, the race was also not without incident as he had run into the back of Lance Stroll during the virtual safety car period, causing minor front wing damage.\nIn Monaco, Verstappen made another error and crashed near the end of the third free practice session in an incident which closely resembled a crash he had at the same spot two years earlier. His team could not repair his car in time for qualifying and Verstappen had to start the race from the back of the grid. Verstappen did not compete and did not set a lap time in qualifying, therefore teammate Ricciardo pressed home Red Bull's advantage at the track by taking pole position and the race win. Verstappen managed to salvage two points by finishing ninth place, overtaking six cars on track. Team principal Christian Horner commented on Verstappen's start of the season, saying he \"needed to stop making these mistakes\" and that he could \"learn from his teammate\", while Helmut Marko, head of driver development at Red Bull, said that Verstappen was \"too impatient\". Verstappen now lay in sixth place in the championship with 35 points, only three points ahead of Fernando Alonso in the McLaren, and 37 points behind his teammate in third, who had taken two wins in the first six races.\nIn Canada, Verstappen topped all three practice sessions and qualified third, two-tenths off Sebastian Vettel in pole position. He eventually finished third and set the fastest lap of the race. The following race in France brought him second place. In Austria\u2014Red Bull's home track, he started fourth on the grid, passed Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen before taking advantage of retirement from Valtteri Bottas and a botched pit-stop strategy by Lewis Hamilton, who later had to retire from fourth place, to claim the fourth race victory of his career. In Britain, Verstappen was plagued by issues, finishing the first practice session early due to a gearbox problem and crashing in the second practice session before retiring from the race due to a brake problem. He would then finish fourth in Germany after strategy errors let a recovering Hamilton get past him as he went on to win the race.

Verstappen ended the first half of the season with a retirement in Hungary and was narrowly behind his teammate in the championship due to his own recent resurgence and Ricciardo's unreliability.\nVerstappen enjoyed a very strong second half of the season, achieving podium finishes in Belgium, Singapore, Japan and the United States, the latter of which he achieved second place having started from 18th on the grid due to a suspension failure in qualifying. Following the qualifying session at the Mexican Grand Prix, Verstappen revealed that a mechanical problem with his Red Bull under braking cost him any chance of becoming the youngest-ever Formula One pole-sitter. As a result, Ricciardo beat Verstappen to pole position by just 0.026 seconds. Verstappen had a better start than Ricciardo and took the lead of the race into the first corner, overtaking the fast-starting Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen earned his fifth career win in Mexico. He was poised to win the 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix, having overtaken R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Vettel, Bottas, and Hamilton. However, he collided with Force India driver Esteban Ocon who was trying to unlap himself on faster tyres. Ocon received a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for the incident. After the collision with Ocon, Verstappen finished in second place behind Hamilton. During an argument with Ocon after the race, Verstappen pushed the Force India driver, for which he was given two days of \"public service\" as a penalty by the FIA. He then finished his season with another podium as he finished third in Abu Dhabi.\nVerstappen ended the season in fourth place in the championship with 249 points, claiming two wins, eleven podium finishes, and two fastest laps.\n\n\n==== 2019\u20132020: Dominance over teammates ====\n\nIn 2019 Red Bull switched from Renault to Honda power units. After Ricciardo moved to the Renault team for 2019, Verstappen was joined at Red Bull by Pierre Gasly. Verstappen qualified in fourth and finished third in Australia, the first podium finish for a Honda-powered driver since the 2008 British Grand Prix. Verstappen was on course for a second third-place finish in Bahrain before a late safety car prevented him from overtaking Charles Leclerc's ailing Ferrari, keeping him in fourth place. Two more fourth-place finishes followed in China and Azerbaijan, and a podium in Spain in third place. In Monaco, Verstappen qualified in third place. He was released into the path of Valtteri Bottas during the drivers' pit stops, gaining second place but receiving a 5-second penalty as a result. Verstappen crossed the line in second place but was demoted to fourth by the penalty.\nIn Canada, Verstappen's final lap in the second qualifying session was hampered by a red flag brought out by Kevin Magnussen's crash. This caused Verstappen to qualify 11th and start the race in ninth place. He later recovered to finish fifth. In France he started and finished in fourth place. In Austria, Verstappen started third but suffered a poor start, dropping down to eighth. After a charge towards the front, he made his way up to second before controversially passing Leclerc for the lead of the race with three laps to go. This marked the first Honda-powered race victory since the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. In Britain, Verstappen, running in third place, was hit from behind during an overtake attempt by Sebastian Vettel and spun into the gravel.

In the race, Verstappen had a poor start and collided with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen at the first corner, resulting in suspension damage and causing Verstappen's first retirement of the season. In Italy, he did not set a time during qualifying after his car lost power in Q1, but he was already required to start from the back of the grid due to an engine component penalty.

This was the first time he achieved back-to-back pole positions. He fought Lewis Hamilton for the race victory, and on lap 53 Verstappen overtook Hamilton, but went off track whilst doing so, resulting in him being instructed by race control to let Hamilton back into the lead and ultimately finishing second behind Hamilton. At the next race, the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third with teammate Sergio P\u00e9rez second, marking the first time he was out-qualified by a teammate since the 2019 Italian Grand Prix. At the race start, Verstappen was able to pass both P\u00e9rez and pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton to take the lead. He remained in the lead after the first round of pit stops as well as the restart, following the race being suspended on lap 33. Rival Hamilton finished second, reducing his championship lead over Verstappen to one point. In the following Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen finished second after a long battle with Lewis Hamilton. At the Spanish Grand Prix, the battle between Verstappen and Hamilton continued, with Hamilton employing a faster two-stop strategy versus Verstappen's one-stop race. This provided Hamilton the advantage of faster tyres, allowing him to overtake Verstappen with several laps remaining in the race. Hamilton took the victory, with Verstappen taking second and the fastest lap, increasing Hamilton's championship lead to 14 points.\nAt the next race in Monaco, Verstappen qualified second behind Charles Leclerc, but Leclerc suffered a driveshaft failure on the way to the grid and was unable to start the race. Verstappen controlled the race from the front on the way to victory. Hamilton (who qualified seventh) finished seventh, though claiming an extra championship point by setting the fastest race lap. The result enabled Verstappen to become the first Dutch driver to lead the World Drivers' Championship, by a margin of four points over Hamilton. At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third behind Leclerc and Hamilton. Verstappen and Hamilton passed Leclerc in the opening laps before Verstappen took the lead by way of a faster pitstop.

At the next race; the British Grand Prix, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision at the Copse corner with Hamilton on the first lap. This resulted in a 51 g (500 m/s2; 1,600 ft/s2) impact with the barrier. He was taken to the Silverstone circuit's medical centre after the crash and was then taken to Coventry hospital for precautionary checks and further assessment, before eventually being discharged at 22:00 local time on Sunday night. Hamilton would go on to win the race, reducing Verstappen's lead in the championship to eight points. At the next race, the Hungarian Grand Prix, Verstappen's car suffered damage in a multi-car collision on lap 1, where Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas was deemed at fault. He ended the race in tenth which was promoted to ninth after Sebastian Vettel was disqualified. The outcome of the race allowed Hamilton to take the lead of the championship.\nFollowing the summer break, Verstappen qualified on pole at the Belgian Grand Prix, ahead of Williams driver George Russell in second and Lewis Hamilton in third. The race was run for three laps, all behind the safety car, with the race official race results taken from the running order at the end of the first lap, with Hamilton and Verstappen both retaining their qualifying positions. As less than 75% of the race distance was completed, half points were awarded, resulting in Verstappen closing the gap to Hamilton to three points. At the Dutch Grand Prix Verstappen again qualified on pole, beating Hamilton by 0.038 seconds. During the race Verstappen was able to fend off attacks from both Mercedes drivers to take the win, taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship by three points.

Verstappen was trailing Hamilton by over 10 seconds until a safety car was called with five laps remaining, following a crash involving Nicholas Latifi. The withdrawal of the safety car and subsequent resumption of the race with one lap remaining was met with further controversy; race director Michael Masi only allowed a certain number of lapped cars through, saving time to allow the race to be restarted once the track had been cleared. Verstappen passed Hamilton at turn five of the final lap of the race to become the first World Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands and the 34th overall.

From this season onward, he would use the number 1 instead of his regular number 33 as the reigning world champion.\nVerstappen retired from second place at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix with a fuel system issue. He won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, having benefited from a pit stop during safety car conditions to pass teammate and pole-sitter P\u00e9rez, but suffered another fuel-related retirement from second place at the Australian Grand Prix. This left him 46 points behind championship leader Charles Leclerc after three races. Verstappen responded by winning the next three races; he achieved sprint victory and a grand slam at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, won from third on the grid at the Miami Grand Prix and gained from Leclerc's retirement at the Spanish Grand Prix to lead the Drivers' Championship. Further wins came at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where Leclerc again retired, and from pole position at the Canadian Grand Prix. Verstappen qualified second at the British Grand Prix, but floor damage from running over debris harmed his pace and resulted in a seventh-place finish. He took pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix and won the sprint, but was overtaken by Leclerc in the race and finished second, reducing his championship lead over Leclerc to 38 points.\nFollowing this, Verstappen went on to win five races consecutively. Pole-sitter Leclerc crashed out of the French Grand Prix, allowing Verstappen to win. Power unit issues meant he qualified tenth for the Hungarian Grand Prix, but overtakes in the opening laps and pit stop undercuts meant he went on to take victory, despite briefly losing the lead after a spin. He set the fastest qualifying time at the Belgian Grand Prix but was demoted to 14th on the grid with a power unit components penalty. Despite this, he progressed to the race lead by lap 12 and went on to win. He took pole position and his 30th race victory at his home race, the Dutch Grand Prix, and then won from seventh on the grid at the Italian Grand Prix.\nVerstappen's winning streak was ended at the Singapore Grand Prix. He ran out of fuel in qualifying and started the race eighth. He lost places at the start and later had to make an extra pit stop due to a tyre lock-up, finishing seventh. Victory from pole at the shortened Japanese Grand Prix gave him a 113-point lead in the standings with four races remaining, securing him his second World Drivers' Championship. He won the next two races, the United States and Mexico City Grands Prix, finished sixth at the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix after a collision with Lewis Hamilton, and won the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix from pole.\nAbu Dhabi was his fifteenth victory of the year, breaking the record of thirteen race wins in a season shared by Michael Schumacher in 2004 and Sebastian Vettel in 2013.

He qualified 0.003 seconds behind Lewis Hamilton at the Hungarian Grand Prix, but overtook him at the first corner and went on to take victory. He claimed pole and the win in the Belgian Grand Prix sprint and set the fastest qualifying time, but started the race sixth due to an engine component penalty. He went on to overtake P\u00e9rez to win the race. He won from pole at the rain-affected Dutch Grand Prix and was victorious again at the Italian Grand Prix despite qualifying behind Carlos Sainz Jr. This victory marked his tenth consecutive win, breaking Sebastian Vettel's record of nine from 2013, and Red Bull's fifteenth consecutive win, a record previously held by McLaren with eleven in 1988.\nBoth Red Bulls were eliminated in Q2 at the Singapore Grand Prix and were unable to make an impression in the race, with Verstappen and P\u00e9rez finishing fifth and eighth respectively, ending the winning streak. This would be the only break in Verstappen's success, as he went on to win the remaining seven races of the season. His victory from pole at the Japanese Grand Prix gave Red Bull their sixth Constructors' Championship title. He clinched his third World Drivers' Championship title at the Qatar Grand Prix sprint despite finishing second to Oscar Piastri, then won the race from pole. He won the United States Grand Prix despite having started sixth due to a lap time deletion in qualifying. He qualified behind both Ferraris at the Mexico City Grand Prix but passed both drivers to claim the win. He took pole and victory at the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix and won the sprint having overtook pole-sitter Lando Norris at the first turn. He started behind Charles Leclerc at the Las Vegas Grand Prix and received a penalty for forcing him off the track, but Verstappen reclaimed the lead to win.\nHis pole and victory at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was his nineteenth win of the year, breaking his own record of fifteen from 2022. He scored 575 points, more than double that of second-placed P\u00e9rez and beating his own points-scoring record from 2022.\n\n\n==== 2024: Fourth title amid struggles at Red Bull ====\n\nVerstappen began the 2024 season with his fifth career grand slam at the Bahrain Grand Prix and followed this with another pole and victory at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, his 100th Formula One podium. He took pole again at the Australian Grand Prix but retired on lap 4, his first retirement since the 2022 edition of the race, with a brake fire, ending his nine-race winning streak and 43 race-finishing streak. This was followed by a pole and win at the Japanese Grand Prix. He won the sprint at the Chinese Grand Prix after starting fourth, then claimed pole and victory in the race. He took another sprint win at the Miami Grand Prix and started on pole position, but lost the lead to Lando Norris during the pit stops and was unable to reclaim the place, finishing the race second. He matched Ayrton Senna's record of eight consecutive poles at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and converted this into his fifth victory of the season. His pole streak ended at the Monaco Grand Prix where he qualified and finished sixth; Verstappen commented that his RB20 was losing time to its rivals in low-speed corners.\nVerstappen and George Russell set identical lap times in qualifying at the Canadian Grand Prix, but Russell started on pole position as he had set the lap time first. Both drivers were overtaken by Norris, but Verstappen later passed Russell then gained the lead from Norris during the pit stops to claim his 60th race win.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39235, "end_char_idx": 43900, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05b9a2ef-2022-4715-904b-1c90cc000461": {"__data__": {"id_": "05b9a2ef-2022-4715-904b-1c90cc000461", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b659543-a9b5-48cc-84ce-1376fcb2b6f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "adf8b7061f45f9685ede2bc7eb9695db2c1f32fe29a357d3c702d532769d77d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "722d56b5-2dff-4a5a-a7bc-31c2892d8bc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0faeabd2a8c4ecc9c5fa1b2e92718545e951d178564b882851b1eeb136720fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "He took another sprint win at the Miami Grand Prix and started on pole position, but lost the lead to Lando Norris during the pit stops and was unable to reclaim the place, finishing the race second.

He qualified second behind Norris at the Spanish Grand Prix but passed him at the start and then overtook Russell to win for the seventh time in 2024. Verstappen won the sprint from pole at the Austrian Grand Prix and then qualified fastest for the main race. He led most of the race but was challenged by Norris in the closing laps before the two drivers collided; Verstappen was handed a time penalty for causing the collision and finished the race fifth. He later commented that the crash did not affect his close friendship with Norris. He qualified fourth at the British Grand Prix and passed Norris in the closing laps to finish second behind Lewis Hamilton. He started third at the Hungarian Grand Prix but collided with Hamilton and went on to finish fifth. He criticised his team's race strategy and suggested that the RB20 was now behind the race-winning McLaren MCL38 on pace.

He recovered positions and was classified fourth in the race, extending his lead in the championship to 78 points over Norris going into the summer break.\n\nAt his home race, the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified second behind Norris and gained the lead at the first corner, but was later overtaken by Norris and finished second. He qualified and finished outside the top four at both the Italian and Azerbaijan Grands Prix, after which Red Bull lost the lead of the Constructors' Championship to McLaren. He then finished second to Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix, reducing his championship advantage to 52 points. Verstappen described his car as \"fucked\" at the official press conference in Singapore, for which he received a punishment from the FIA to \"accomplish some work of public interest\". He responded by hosting an impromptu media session outside the press conference room in protest, and later suggested that the decision could push him to leave the sport. He won the sprint at the United States Grand Prix and was classified third in the race ahead of Norris, who was penalised for overtaking Verstappen off-track. This extended Verstappen's championship lead for the first time since the Belgian Grand Prix. He started second at the Mexico City Grand Prix but received 20 seconds worth of penalties for his driving during a battle for position with Norris, resulting in a sixth-place finish, reducing his championship lead to 47 points.\n\nVerstappen was classified fourth in the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix sprint after receiving a virtual safety car infringement penalty, and started the race from 17th following an engine penalty, whilst Norris qualified on pole. He gained seven positions on the opening lap, with further places obtained via several crucial overtakes, as well as surviving the worsening conditions on his intermediate tyres until the red flag period. Following this\u2014and his overtake for the lead on Ocon\u2014Verstappen set ten of the eleven fastest laps of the race, with his quickest being 1.045 seconds quicker than any of his rivals; he won by a 19-second margin, increasing his championship lead to 62 points.

After the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Verstappen became the first driver to win a title driving for a third-placed team in the World Constructors' Championship since Nelson Piquet in 1983.\n\n\n==== 2025: Challenger to McLaren ====\n\nRed Bull trailed McLaren for performance into 2025, with Verstappen finishing second at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix after battling Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri for the lead in wet conditions. He claimed third in the sprint and fourth in the main race in China amidst tyre wear and performance struggles with the RB21, whilst new teammate Liam Lawson finished outside the points; Verstappen claimed Red Bull had also dropped behind Ferrari and Mercedes, as Lawson was replaced by Yuki Tsunoda. He received widespread acclaim for his surprise pole position at the Japanese Grand Prix, before holding off both McLaren drivers to claim his first victory of the year; Andrew Benson of BBC Sport described it as \"a weekend of the sort of rare perfection that comes only from drivers of the very highest quality\". He finished sixth in Bahrain amidst further performance and pit stop struggles, prompting Red Bull to hold crisis talks over his future. He returned to pole in Saudi Arabia, where he finished second after receiving a penalty for a first-corner incident with Piastri. Verstappen finished fourth in the Miami sprint, demoted to seventeenth following a penalty for an unsafe pit release; he took pole for the main race, ultimately finishing fourth. He won the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix after a first-lap overtake on Piastri into Variante Tamburello, which was widely hailed as one of his greatest.\n\n\n== Driver profile ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 47054, "end_char_idx": 49600, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8b2c1f9-bc1b-418a-97d6-f47c033e6210": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8b2c1f9-bc1b-418a-97d6-f47c033e6210", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "722d56b5-2dff-4a5a-a7bc-31c2892d8bc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0faeabd2a8c4ecc9c5fa1b2e92718545e951d178564b882851b1eeb136720fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b83c7eab-ae2d-408f-8c30-7e55572b77b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb110e2c212ae955495489abc500dfb67a1320337d3a5c372391acad3e27c3bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Driver profile ==\n\n\n=== Qualifying pace and consistency ===\n\nFollowing Verstappen's maiden pole position at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix, former Formula One World Champion Nico Rosberg described him as the fastest driver in Formula One. Rosberg elucidated that Verstappen did not have the fastest car during the qualifying session in Hungary, emphasising that it was Verstappen's raw speed that allowed him to secure pole position: \"Mercedes still had the fastest car, and it's just Verstappen with his driving that put it up there in pole.\"\nIn 2019, former Formula One World Champion Jenson Button stated that he believes Verstappen is the fastest Formula One driver ever: \"I think he is the fastest driver that has ever driven an F1 car. I really do, I think he is unbelievably fast.\" Journalist Scott Mitchell from The Race commented: \"When everything comes together, Verstappen is the quickest driver in F1 over one lap, but the odd mistake and scruffy session must be eliminated.\" Helmut Marko, the advisor to the Red Bull GmbH Formula One teams, stated that Verstappen is the fastest driver Red Bull have ever had.\nIn 2021, three-time Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart claimed that Verstappen is the fastest driver in Formula One, but he also added that Verstappen is still in the \"puppy stage\" of his career. Peter Windsor, an experienced Formula One journalist, expressed Verstappen's ability to change direction \"quicker than anybody else\" through the high-speed section Maggots and Becketts: Silverstone's fastest sequence of corners. Windsor stressed that Verstappen's lightning-quick change of direction is a result of the innate feel he has for creating the \"perfect platform\" to achieve what he wants with the car during a lap. He is intrinsically able to create, for \"a trillionth of a second\", a minuscule \"flat area\" between the left and the right of a change of direction ahead of him, in order to attain a stable balance with the car before applying the next steering and throttle input. Scuderia AlphaTauri's team principal, Franz Tost, declared Verstappen to be the fastest driver in Formula One; following the Dutchman's \"really deserved\" maiden title triumph in 2021. After winning the 2024 World Drivers' Championship in the third-placed RB20, James Elson of Motor Sport stated \"if there was any doubt beforehand, 2024 proved that Max Verstappen is F1\u2019s best driver\", adding that \"not only the fastest, capable of creating one-lap magic, he knows how to produce all it takes to win in the race too\".\nVerstappen received widespread acclaim for his surprise pole lap at the 2025 Japanese Grand Prix, with Andrew Benson of BBC Sport commenting that \"many F1 observers regarded [Verstappen's qualifying lap] as one of the greatest of all time\".", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 49580, "end_char_idx": 52356, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b83c7eab-ae2d-408f-8c30-7e55572b77b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b83c7eab-ae2d-408f-8c30-7e55572b77b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8b2c1f9-bc1b-418a-97d6-f47c033e6210", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d17387d854c176731fbc7fce8a8aaeee6833f074622a340704955cb9b62ef9df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e05afa12-5a8c-4218-b281-feb7d1922369", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a955236774f20f248a97d725073f598bfe62cdf89a8c3c22a4c5b8d0fdbac40b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Dominance over teammates ===\n\nFormer Formula One driver Eddie Irvine praised Verstappen, stating that he is \"by far the most dominant team leader on the grid.\" Irvine highlighted that Verstappen \"has had many different second drivers in the team and none of them have got close to him.\" During the 2020 season, Jenson Button stated that he does not \"think there's been a driver that's annihilated their teammates like he [Verstappen] has in a very long time.\" Motorsport columnist and former Formula One driver Jolyon Palmer, commented that Verstappen's maiden World Championship triumph could usher in a \"new era of dominance\" in the sport. Palmer wrote:[Verstappen's] qualifying pace is frightening and has been the basis for this title-charging campaign. He's had the most pole positions of anyone with 10 \u2013 almost half of the races, and it would have been half had he completed his mesmeric Jeddah lap, which ended up being possibly Max's biggest error in a near-perfect season. For a driver who has demolished three successive team mates in three years and made only a handful of small mistakes in that time, you question what scope their [sic]  even is for improvement \u2013 but if he can take his game onto another level from here, we could be about to see the start of a new era of dominance.Journalist Scott Mitchell expounded the reason why the Dutchman's teammates have fallen short \"even with the data\". Mitchell wrote: \"Verstappen drives mainly on intuition, and that comes from years of training and preparation. He has a database in his head which he can use immediately. Even with data, Gasly and Albon could see where he was faster, but they could never grasp how he was faster there. That's because what makes Verstappen so good is mainly unconscious.\" According to Mitchell, those years of training and driving on his intuition has made it impossible for other drivers to measure up to Verstappen.\n\nHelmut Marko asserted that Verstappen's progress has moved him clear of his former Formula 1 team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, in both qualifying and race trim. \"There is specific data,\" Marko told Autosport, \"In qualifying the gap to Ricciardo is greater. The strange thing is Max sometimes slides more, but still manages to keep the tyres alive.\" Verstappen previously mentioned that he was three or four-tenths faster on average than \"very fast qualifier\" Daniel Ricciardo. Marko concluded that then 20-year-old Verstappen \"clearly moved away\" from Ricciardo since the \"second half of the 2018 season.\"\n\n\n=== Natural talent ===\n\nFollowing his maiden Formula One win, at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, three-time World Drivers' Champion Niki Lauda described Verstappen as the \"talent of the century.\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner stated that Verstappen is the best driver Red Bull have ever seen: \"I have no doubt [Verstappen is] the best we have seen on one of our cars, in terms of outright raw ability and commitment. He's the best driver we've seen.\"\nGerhard Berger echoed 2009 World Drivers' Champion Jenson Button's comments, anointing Max Verstappen as the Formula One driver of this era with the most raw talent. Speaking to Sport1, Berger ventured: \"When it comes to raw talent, Max Verstappen is the most talented of all. But it's not just about raw talent, it's about the whole package. That means it's not just about setting the fastest laps but also to win a race. And not just [about] one race but many and eventually a championship, and championships.\"\nTwo-time World Drivers' Champion Fernando Alonso commented that Verstappen is the standout driver in Formula One, declaring him to be \"one step ahead\" of everyone. Alonso noted that Verstappen deserved to win the 2021 Formula One World Championship, ahead of the title decider that saw Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton enter level on points: \"Mercedes lately have been more performing and they've won a couple of races now, but Max is driving\u2014in my opinion\u2014one step ahead of all of us. We saw the [qualifying] lap in Jeddah, until he touched the wall at the last corner, that lap was coming from Max, not the Red Bull.\" Karun Chandhok likened Verstappen's ruthless and uncompromising attitude in race combat to seven-time World Drivers' Champion Michael Schumacher.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 52359, "end_char_idx": 56613, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e05afa12-5a8c-4218-b281-feb7d1922369": {"__data__": {"id_": "e05afa12-5a8c-4218-b281-feb7d1922369", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b83c7eab-ae2d-408f-8c30-7e55572b77b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb110e2c212ae955495489abc500dfb67a1320337d3a5c372391acad3e27c3bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e64564e1-43a4-491a-a90c-7f91fc9258ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac1401463d7b39dda3733007492e34b0f7f7fd67231e4c4aaffa3b1b13ee45b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Racecraft ===\n\nFollowing Verstappen being given a warning for his driving conduct at the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix, the 18-year-old received the backing of then three-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who commented: \"firstly, give the guy a break, he is 18 years old. What the frickin' heck were any of us doing at 18?\"\nDespite earning high praise and acclaim from Formula One drivers and experts in and out of the sport, Verstappen faced criticism in the wake of the penalties he incurred during the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Following this race, former Formula One driver Martin Brundle wrote: \"Such is [his] car control and cunning, he's sometimes able to pull off the audacious moves and leave a margin of doubt as to whether it's hard racing or simply a professional foul outside of the regulations and it's those moments which are generating the confusion, controversies and inconsistencies. Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher had their faults too, and I was on the receiving end from both of them on occasions, but it's a sizeable dent on their immense reputations, not a positive.\" Following an impressive first half of the 2022 season, journalist David Tremayne claimed Verstappen had elevated himself to a new higher level compared to his 2021 title winning season, suggesting Verstappen's first title had made him more relaxed and \"chirpy\".\nFollowing the 2024 Mexico City Grand Prix, Verstappen received widespread condemnation from fans and media for incidents involving title rival Lando Norris, for which he received 20 seconds worth of time penalties. Many commentators and former drivers likened his tactics and 'win-at-all-costs' attitude to those of Senna and Schumacher, whilst 1996 World Drivers' Champion Damon Hill characterised them as reminiscent of Wacky Races antagonist Dick Dastardly. Before the following race in S\u00e3o Paulo, Verstappen criticised the alleged British bias in the media, stating \"I have the wrong passport\". Upon his victory from 17th on the grid in the rain-affected race, he stated in the post-race press conference \"I appreciate all of you being here, but I don't see any British press. Do they have to run to the airport, or [do they not] know where the press conference is?\"\n\n\n=== Fan support ===\n\nVerstappen has accumulated a significant fanbase from around the world, particularly from his home country of the Netherlands. The frequent association of Verstappen with the colour orange\u2014the national colour of the Netherlands\u2014has led to his fanbase being referred to as the Orange Army.\nSeveral races across Europe have dedicated Verstappen grandstands to accommodate thousands of travelling Dutch fans, boosting ticket sales at Grands Prix such as in Belgium, Austria and Hungary. A Verstappen grandstand featured at the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023.\nDuring the 2021 Dutch Grand Prix, the managing director of Honda in Formula One, Masashi Yamamoto, praised Verstappen's support, stating that \"in the six years I've been involved with Honda F1, I've never seen such a great turnout as at the Dutch Grand Prix. It was like being in a football stadium.\"\nIn October 2021, Verstappen was voted the most popular Formula One driver in an official worldwide survey conducted by Nielsen Media Research and Motorsport Network, earning 14.4% of the vote with particular success in the United States and Japan.\nThe fan-made song \"Super Max!\", performed by the Pitstop Boys in 2016, went viral after his victory at the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, topping the Spotify Viral 50 chart in the Netherlands and reaching number two in the United Kingdom. Another fan-made EDM track \"33 Max Verstappen\", was released in 2023, eventually going viral on social media due to internet memes referencing the hook: \"tu tu tu du, Max Verstappen\".\n\n\n== Other racing ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 56616, "end_char_idx": 60418, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e64564e1-43a4-491a-a90c-7f91fc9258ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "e64564e1-43a4-491a-a90c-7f91fc9258ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e05afa12-5a8c-4218-b281-feb7d1922369", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a955236774f20f248a97d725073f598bfe62cdf89a8c3c22a4c5b8d0fdbac40b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e71ca21-dd37-413c-8d53-cd8c4abe9339", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "82b96137510ba63614efe112b4b5820fc66d71e4d7902f611192bb5b27e077fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Other racing ==\n\n\n=== Sportscar racing ===\n\nVerstappen tested the Honda NSX-GT\u2014a GT500 class Super GT car\u2014during the 2022 Honda Racing Thanks Day event at Motegi. After winning the event's kart race alongside Marc M\u00e1rquez, Honda awarded Verstappen\u2014the first Honda-powered World Drivers' Champion since 1991\u2014with an NSX Type S.\nIn January 2024, Verstappen drove the Ferrari 296 GT3 at the Portim\u00e3o, as part of a two-day test with Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters team Emil Frey Racing alongside Thierry Vermeulen, who competed under the Verstappen.com Racing banner in 2023. Team principal Lorenz Frey-Hilti stated \"there were also other GT3 cars that day, but I can only say that Verstappen was driving on a different level than the rest. There are good drivers who cannot shine in a GT3 car due to a lack of experience, but Max is different. If something has four wheels, then [he's fast in it]\", adding that he was \"world-class\". He later entered testing for the third round of the 2025 N\u00fcrburgring Langstrecken-Serie in the 296 under the pseudonym \"Franz Hermann\", where he claimed to set an unofficial GT3 lap record, reportedly in an attempt to obtain a license to compete on the Nordschleife.\nOn 19 November 2024, Verstappen drove a prototype for the first time, testing the Acura ARX-06 with Honda Racing Corporation at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Verstappen expressed his desire to compete in the 24 Hours of Daytona and Le Mans after the test, stating that \"it's just about finding the time\".\n\n\n=== Sim racing ===\nIn his free time, Verstappen competes in sim racing. Verstappen stated that it helps him with his real-life racing, keeping him \"ready to go\". Since 2015, Verstappen has been a member of Team Redline, a British-Luxembourgish multinational professional sim racing team.\n\n\n==== iRacing Special Events (2020\u2013present) ====\n\nVerstappen has competed in several marquee events on iRacing since February 2019, when he entered the Bathurst 12 Special Event\u2014a 12-hour virtual team endurance race\u2014alongside Lando Norris. The pair won the Spa 24 Special Event in July. Verstappen won the Petit Le Mans Special Event in October 2020. Later that year, Haas driver and R8G eSports founder Romain Grosjean deemed Verstappen to be the \"fastest\" driver in sim racing. He entered the eighth round of the 2023 AMX Global League at Imola, winning the first heat.\nVerstappen entered the Daytona 24 Special Event in January 2024, winning the GTD class with Redline. In May, Verstappen received media attention for entering the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Special Event on the same weekend as the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix; he won both events, achieving a record-equalling eighth consecutive pole position at the latter. Following his victory at the former, Ed Hardy of Autosport opined that Verstappen had \"firmly established himself as one of the best sim racers in the world\". Verstappen won his second Spa 24 Special Event in July that year, completing a perfect season of 24-hour special events.\n\n\n==== Le Mans Virtual (2020\u20132023) ====\n\nVerstappen competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual on rFactor 2 in 2020, 2022 and 2023\u2014hosted by Automobile Club de l'Ouest and the FIA World Endurance Championship\u2014as well as two further rounds of the 2022\u201323 Le Mans Virtual Series in the LMP2 class. He described the former competition as a \"clown show\" after a technical issue saw him retire from the lead of the 2023 edition, subsequently finishing runner-up in the overall championship to Porsche Coanda.\n\n\n== Verstappen.com Racing ==\n\nVerstappen founded the eponymous racing team Verstappen.com Racing in 2022, supporting his father Jos in rallying and Thierry Vermeulen in the ADAC GT Masters.

He stated in 2014 that he \"feels more Dutch\", having spent more time with his father than with his mother during his childhood, as well as his upbringing in Maaseik, a Belgian town at the Dutch border. The following year, Verstappen added that he \"actually only lived in Belgium to sleep\", and that he \"was raised as a Dutch person and that's how [he feels]\". In 2022, Verstappen stated that he appreciates both sides and is \"half-half at the end of the day\".\n\nHe competed in Formula One for more than a season before obtaining a road driving licence on his 18th birthday. Verstappen moved to Monaco the day after, in October 2015 where he has lived ever since. In November 2020, Verstappen bought a Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft from Virgin Galactic. The aircraft, registered PH-DTF, was operated by Exxaero. In January 2025, he acquired a Mangusta GranSport 33 yacht, named Unleash the Lion. The following month, he sold the Falcon 900EX and purchased a Dassault Falcon 8X, registered PH-UTL, which is also operated by Exxaero.\nVerstappen is a supporter of FC Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven. Verstappen speaks three languages, Dutch, English and German, the latter of which he learned while karting with Michael Schumacher. In September 2022, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in recognition of his racing achievements.\nVerstappen has been dating Brazilian-Dutch model Kelly Piquet, daughter of three-time World Drivers' Champion Nelson Piquet, since October 2020. They had their first daughter, Lily, in April 2025.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n\n\n=== Formula One ===\nFormula One World Drivers' Championship: 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024\nDHL Fastest Lap Award: 2022, 2023\nFIA Action of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2019\nFIA Rookie of the Year: 2015\nFIA Personality of the Year: 2015, 2016, 2017\nLorenzo Bandini Trophy: 2016\n\n\n=== Other awards ===\nTime 100: 2024\nLaureus World Sportsman of the Year: 2022\nDutch Sportsman of the Year: 2016, 2021, 2022\nAutosport International Racing Driver Award: 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024\nBest Driver ESPY Award: 2023, 2024\nFIA Action of the Year: 2014\nAutosport Awards Rookie of the Year: 2015\nAutosport Awards Moment of the Year: 2024\n\n\n=== Orders and special awards ===\n Netherlands\n Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau (2022)\n\n\n== Karting record ==\n\n\n=== Karting career summary ===\n\n\n=== Complete CIK-FIA Karting European Championship results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\n=== Complete CIK-FIA Karting World Championship results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\n== Racing record ==\n\n\n=== Racing career summary ===\n\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\n=== Complete FIA European Formula 3 Championship results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\n=== Complete Macau Grand Prix results ===\n\n\n=== Complete Formula One results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicates fastest lap)\n\n\u2020 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.\n\u2021 Half points awarded as less than 75% of race distance was completed.\n* Season still in progress.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 63926, "end_char_idx": 67893, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9583a9d1-f969-45da-af6d-752ad9ea6ab7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9583a9d1-f969-45da-af6d-752ad9ea6ab7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41758713", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd0533f482eab0bd3aff594217b071652f41b5733847b00bfca011dea7985b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e71ca21-dd37-413c-8d53-cd8c4abe9339", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "82b96137510ba63614efe112b4b5820fc66d71e4d7902f611192bb5b27e077fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Complete CIK-FIA Karting World Championship results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\n== Racing record ==\n\n\n=== Racing career summary ===\n\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\n=== Complete FIA European Formula 3 Championship results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\n\n=== Complete Macau Grand Prix results ===\n\n\n=== Complete Formula One results ===\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicates fastest lap)\n\n\u2020 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.\n\u2021 Half points awarded as less than 75% of race distance was completed.\n* Season still in progress.\n\n\n==== Formula One records ====\nVerstappen holds the following Formula One records:\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nMax Verstappen career summary at DriverDB.com", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 67157, "end_char_idx": 68109, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72a9eeaa-48c8-4418-ab18-77682ef321ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "72a9eeaa-48c8-4418-ab18-77682ef321ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "897b9c03-7544-4389-b08c-6b9cf161a9df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcd42efa11514fac46f5d352670843b50c8c25bb39021f3c82669f57a5eb3572", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Formula One race weekend refers to an auto racing event which takes place over three days (usually Friday to Sunday), with a series of practice and qualifying sessions prior to the race on Sunday. Current regulations provide for two free practice sessions on Friday, a morning practice session and an afternoon qualifying session held on Saturday, and the race held on Sunday afternoon or evening, although the structure of the weekend has changed numerous times over the history of the sport. Historically, the Monaco Grand Prix held practice on Thursday rather than Friday (up to and including 2021), and the whole schedule for the Las Vegas (starting from its inaugural event in 2023), Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix (in 2024 only) is brought forward by one day. At most Formula One race weekends, other events such as races in other F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) series, such as Formula 2 or Formula 3, are held.\n\n\n== Free practice ==\n\nSince 2006, three free practice sessions (often abbreviated to FP1, FP2, and FP3) are held before the race. The first is typically held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon, while the third session is typically on Saturday morning. From 2021, all sessions last for one hour; prior to this, the Friday sessions were 90 minutes in length and the Saturday session was one hour in length. In addition in 2021, cars are now put under parc ferm\u00e9 conditions after the third practice session instead of qualifying. Private tests are now heavily restricted, but a third driver (such as a reserve, test, or junior driver) is permitted to take part in the first Friday free practice session in the place of a regular driver. The second practice session for the Bahrain, Singapore and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix takes place in the evening, as these races are run at night. All practice sessions for the Las Vegas Grand Prix were held at night, with the first two on Thursday, the third and qualifying on Friday and the race held on Saturday.\n\n\n== Qualifying ==\n\nA qualifying session is held before each race to determine the order cars will be lined up in at the start of the race, with the fastest qualifier starting at the front and the slowest at the back. Drivers who could not set a time for any reason are also relegated to the back.\n\n\n=== Historical methods ===\nTraditionally before 1996, qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday (Thursday at Monaco) afternoon from 13:00 to 14:00 local time, with the second held on Saturday afternoon at the same time. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards their final grid position. Each driver was limited to twelve laps per qualifying session.\nIn 1996, qualifying was amended with the Friday qualifying session abolished in a favour for a single qualifying session held on Saturday afternoon. As previously, each driver was limited to twelve laps with the inclusion of a 107% rule to exclude drivers with slow lap times. This was calculated by using the time of the driver on pole position and adding on 7% to create a cut-off time. This format remained until the conclusion of the 2002 season. Between 2003 and 2005, the qualifying session was run as a one-lap session and took place on Friday and Saturday afternoon with the cars running one at a time. In 2003, the Friday running order was determined with the leader of the Drivers' Championship heading out first. The Saturday running order was determined by times set in Friday afternoon qualifying with the fastest heading out last and the slowest running first. No refuelling was allowed between the start of Saturday qualifying and the start of the race, so drivers qualified on race fuel. The lap times from the Friday afternoon session did not determine the grid order.\nIn 2004, the Friday session was moved to Saturday. The running order for the first session was now based on the result of the previous race. At first both sessions were held back-to-back, but the first session was later moved earlier in the day. At the start of 2005, the sessions were held on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Lap times from both sessions were counted to give the overall aggregate position. From the 2005 European Grand Prix onwards, the Sunday morning session was dropped for a single run on Saturday afternoon having proved unpopular with drivers, teams and broadcasters. The running order was the reverse of the previous race result.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4470, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "897b9c03-7544-4389-b08c-6b9cf161a9df": {"__data__": {"id_": "897b9c03-7544-4389-b08c-6b9cf161a9df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "72a9eeaa-48c8-4418-ab18-77682ef321ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66b956c5176570f97a7f884483936fde62298fb80cd7dceb9988095ac8aed87b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2cd974e1-9a7c-4ba0-890e-a07968b87db4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d7e957f733d114677318dc14da7c0d9c4feca68374c18710898773b61efc953", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Current format ===\nSince 2006, qualifying takes place on Saturday afternoon in a three-stage \"knockout\" system. One hour is dedicated to determining the grid order, divided into three periods with short intermissions between them. Since 2010, the first qualifying period (Q1) is eighteen minutes long, with all twenty cars competing. At the end of Q1, the five slowest drivers are eliminated from further qualification rounds, and fill positions sixteen to twenty on the grid based on their fastest lap time. Any driver attempting to set a qualifying time when the period ends is permitted to finish their lap, though no new laps may be started once the chequered flag is shown. After a short break, the second period (Q2) (15 minutes long) begins, with fifteen cars on the circuit. At the end of Q2, the five slowest drivers are once again eliminated, filling grid positions eleven to fifteen. Finally, the third qualifying period (Q3) (12 minutes long) features the ten fastest drivers from the second period. The drivers are issued a new set of soft tyres and have twelve minutes to set a qualifying time, which will determine the top ten positions on the grid. The driver who sets the fastest qualifying time is said to be on pole position, the grid position that offers the best physical position from which to start the race.\nDrivers may complete as many laps as they choose within the permitted qualifying session's time. As of the 2022 season, all drivers are permitted to start the race on the tyre of their choice regardless of their grid position, whereas previously it was required for the drivers starting in the top 10 grid positions to start on the same tyre as the one that they set their fastest lap time within the second qualifying session. Generally, a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track in order to get to the start/finish line (the out-lap). Having crossed the line, they will attempt to achieve the quickest time around the circuit that they can in one or more laps (the flying lap or hot lap). This is the lap time which is used in calculating grid position. Finally, the driver will continue back around the track and re-enter the pit lane (the in-lap); however, this is merely strategy, and no teams are obliged by the rules to follow this formula, as drivers may elect to set several flying laps before returning to the pits. For the first two races of the 2016 season, a modified format was used where drivers were eliminated during the sessions rather than just at the end and only eight drivers progressed to the final session. Qualifying reverted to the previous format from the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix onwards.\n\n\n==== Sprint qualifying ====\nFollowing the decision to make sprints standalone from 2023 onwards, sprints were given a dedicated qualifying session, dubbed in 2023 \"sprint shootout\" and \"sprint qualifying\" in 2024. The format of sprint shootout is the same as qualifying, but with the three segments (dubbed \"SQ1\", \"SQ2\" and \"SQ3\" instead of \"Q1\", \"Q2\" and \"Q3\") being shorter at 12 minutes, 10 minutes and 8 minutes, instead of 18, 15 and 12 minutes. Initially, new tyres were mandatory for each phase, with mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3. This was changed for the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix to allow teams the ability to use any set of soft tyres, be it new or used, for SQ3, after Lando Norris could not run in SQ3 at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, after exhausting his allocation of soft tyres.\n\n\n=== Qualifying requirements ===\nAs of 2025, ten teams are entered for the Formula One World Championship, each entering two cars for a total of twenty cars. The regulations place a limit of twenty-six entries for the championship. At some periods in the history of Formula One the number of cars entered for each race has exceeded the number permitted, which historically would vary from race to race according to the circuit used; Monaco, for example, for many years allowed only twenty cars to compete because of the restricted space available.

Because of the dangers of having so many cars on the track at the same time, pre-qualifying sessions were re-introduced for the teams with the worst record over the previous twelve months, including any new teams. Usually, only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed into the qualifying session proper, where thirty cars competed for twenty-six places on the starting grid for the race. The slowest cars from the pre-qualifying session were listed in race results as 'Did Not Pre-Qualify' (DNPQ). Pre-qualifying was discontinued after the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix when many small teams withdrew from the sport.\n\n\n==== 107% rule ====\n\nAs the number of cars entered in the world championship fell below twenty-six, a situation arose in which any car entered would automatically qualify for the race, no matter how slowly it had been driven. The 107% rule was introduced in 1996 to prevent completely uncompetitive cars being entered in the championship. If a car's qualifying time was not within 107% of the pole sitter's time, that car would not qualify for the race, unless at the discretion of the race stewards for a situation such as a rain-affected qualifying session. For example, if the pole-sitter's time was one minute and forty seconds, any car eligible for racing had to set a time within one minute and forty-seven seconds.\nThe 107% rule was removed in 2003 since the FIA's rules indicated previously that 24 cars could take the start of a Formula One race, and a minimum of twenty cars had to enter a race. In 2003, the qualifying procedure changed to a single-lap system, rendering the rule inoperable. However, there were concerns about the pace of the new teams in the 2010 season. As the qualifying procedure had been changed since the 2006 season to a three-part knockout system, the rule could now be reintroduced. As such, the 107% rule was reintroduced in the 2011 Formula One season. Currently, cars eliminated in Q1 have to be within 107% of the fastest Q1 time in order to qualify for the race.\nSince the rule was re-introduced, only twice have cars failed to qualify for a Grand Prix \u2013 both times involving Hispania Racing cars and both times occurring at the Australian Grand Prix, namely in 2011 (Vitantonio Liuzzi and Narain Karthikeyan) and 2012 (Karthikeyan and Pedro de la Rosa). At their discretion, stewards may permit a driver who fails to set a qualifying time within the desired 107% span to enter the race; for example, at the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lance Stroll and Brendon Hartley both failed to set times within 107%, but were permitted to race on the grounds of satisfactory lap times in free practice. After eleven drivers failed to set satisfactory Q1 times at the 2016 Hungarian Grand Prix due to inclement weather, the regulations were amended in 2018 so that wet sessions were not subject to the 107% rule.\n\n\n=== Grid penalties ===\nDrivers or cars may be issued penalties against their starting positions, commonly for exceeding component limits, or sporting offences in free practice, qualifying, or a previous race.

This can lead to the starting grid being significantly different from the qualifying order.\n\n\n== Sprint ==\n\nDuring the 2021 Formula One World Championship, Formula One trialed a \"sprint qualifying\" system at three Grands Prix\u2014Great Britain, Italy, and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2014in which the grid for the race on Sunday was determined by a 100 km sprint on Saturday. On a race weekend with sprint qualifying, the sessions on Friday, instead of regular two practice sessions, consisted of one practice session and a traditional qualifying session, which was limited to soft tyres and which set the grid for sprint qualifying. Only the winner of the sprint qualifying was considered to have taken pole position for the main Grand Prix, and they received a trophy similar to the pole position trophy awarded at other race weekends. The top three finishers in sprint qualifying in 2021 received World Championship points in a 3\u20132\u20131 scoring system. Formula One stuck with having sprints at three events, after initially planning to increase it to six events. These plans were abandoned after teams failed to agree on the cost-cap considerations for additional sprint events.\nFor 2022 season, \"sprint qualifying\" was renamed to \"sprint\". The weekend format remained unchanged from 2021 and was run at the Emilia Romagna, Austrian, and S\u00e3o Paulo Grands Prix with points now awarded to the top eight finishers rather than the top three finishers as was the case in 2021. Unlike the 2021 season, the driver who set the fastest time in qualifying was credited as the official pole-sitter (unless penalised), with the winner of the sprint continuing to have the right to start the main race from the first-place grid position.\nFrom 2023, standalone sprint events were implemented, meaning that the outcome of the sprint race would no longer set the grid for the main race. These plans were approved a few days before the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix \u2013 the first of the six events on the 2023 calendar to feature the sprint format. The format for sprint events in 2023 featured Friday consisting of a single practice session followed by the qualifying session which set the starting grid for the main race on Sunday; while Saturday featured a special qualifying session, named the sprint shootout, which set the grid for the sprint race (called the \"sprint\") which was also held later on Saturday. The structure of the sprint weekends was changed again  for 2024, with the goal of rationalising sprint events and separating them from the rest of the Grand Prix weekend. The sprint shootout, which sets the starting grid order for the sprint race, was moved to Friday afternoon after the weekend's only practice session. The sprint shootout was also renamed sprint qualifying. The sprint will then be the first session to take place on Saturday, followed by qualifying for the main race. The Grand Prix itself remains on Sunday. For the first three seasons of the sprint format, there was a single parc ferm\u00e9 period starting from Friday's Grand Prix qualifying session all the way through to the start of the Grand Prix. However, for 2024, there are two separate parc ferm\u00e9 periods: the first lasts from the start of sprint qualifying to the start of the Sprint and the second lasts from Saturday's Grand Prix qualifying to the start of the Grand Prix itself. This is intended to allow teams to fine tune their cars between the end of the sprint and the start of Grand Prix qualifying.\n\n\n== Race ==\n\nThe race itself is held on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of night races at Singapore, Bahrain, Qatar, Las Vegas, and Saudi Arabia and a day/night race for the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The Las Vegas Grand Prix was held on a Saturday, with the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix provisioned to move to a Saturday in 2024; prior to that, the last race not to take place on a Sunday was the 1985 South African Grand Prix, which took place on a Saturday.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11745, "end_char_idx": 15884, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "deb79332-dfed-4448-ba5d-e1c2c1d3e0b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "deb79332-dfed-4448-ba5d-e1c2c1d3e0b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f87cf690-46fc-447c-a6da-f0700a855007", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "925ddd191c982d89de6e152ddb7f3c83210b4191c34d43f3ed5417557ccfca68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3ca0e6a-ce7a-4a36-9f7a-e7c765fdb2eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7783d1ddd49aafc819d3a614bef12202c1cb8a8af8aa9ea78df7b3442cc1d593", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Race ==\n\nThe race itself is held on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of night races at Singapore, Bahrain, Qatar, Las Vegas, and Saudi Arabia and a day/night race for the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

At the hour of the race, a green light signifies the beginning of the relatively slow formation lap during which all cars parade around the course doing a final tyre warmup and system checks. The cars then return to their assigned grid spot for the standing race start. The starting light system, which consists of five pairs of lights mounted above the start/finish line, then lights up each pair at one-second intervals. Once all five pairs are illuminated, after a random length of time between 0.2 and 3 seconds, the red lights are turned off by the race director, at which point the race starts. The race length is defined as the smallest number of complete laps that exceeds 305 kilometres (the Monaco Grand Prix is the sole exception with a race length of 78 laps / 260.5 km), though occasionally some races are truncated due to special circumstances. The race can not exceed two hours in length\u2014if this interval is reached, the race will be ended at the end of the next full lap\u2014unless the race is halted by a red flag, in which case the total time including the red flag stoppage must not exceed three hours, and the total time excluding the red flag stoppage may not exceed two hours. At the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, the three hour countdown was stopped with force majeure being cited.\n\n\n=== Pit stops ===\n\nEach driver is also required to use two different types of dry compound during a dry race, and so must make a mandatory pit stop. Timing pit stops with reference to other cars is crucial\u2014if they are following another car but are unable to pass, the driver may try to stay on the track as long as possible, or pit immediately, as newer tyres are usually faster. Prior to the 2010 season, drivers used to make pit stops for fuel more than once during a race, as the cars on average traveled two kilometres per litre (approximately five miles per gallon). Nowadays this figure is higher, due to changes in engines from 2014, and as a result refuelling has been forbidden during a race since 2010. If a driver starts the race using intermediate or wet tyres, they are not mandated to make a pit stop.\n\n\n=== Podium ceremony ===\nAt the end of the race, the first, second and third-placed drivers take their places on a podium, where they stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of their team is played. Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers and a constructor's trophy to a representative from the winner's team, and the winning drivers spray champagne and are interviewed. The three drivers then go to a media room for a press conference where they answer questions in English and their native languages.\n\n\n== Points system ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15410, "end_char_idx": 18888, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3ca0e6a-ce7a-4a36-9f7a-e7c765fdb2eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3ca0e6a-ce7a-4a36-9f7a-e7c765fdb2eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "645533", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37ab44695996bd54dd5b587bdf1c586f3d09b9ef80e84ebac8bb1fc2e4539fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "deb79332-dfed-4448-ba5d-e1c2c1d3e0b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e334b2a6a86034ea46ea167b0f3362f801c098547f2f8be71dc963c392b53405", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Podium ceremony ===\nAt the end of the race, the first, second and third-placed drivers take their places on a podium, where they stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of their team is played.

In 1961, the scoring was revised to give the winner nine points instead of eight, and the single point awarded for fastest lap was given for sixth place for the first time the previous year. In 1991, the points system was again revised to give the victor 10 points, with all other scorers recording the same 6\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 result. In 2003, the FIA further revised the scoring system to apportion points to the first eight classified finishers (a classified finisher must complete 90% of race distance) on a 10\u20138\u20136\u20135\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 basis.\nAt certain points between 1950 and 1990, drivers' points for the season would be tallied based on their best results across the World Championship, which varied from 4 to 11 in a season, and during the late 1960s and 1970s points would be tallied based on their best results from each half of the season, which varied from four to seven. This was done in order to equalise the footings of teams which may not have had the wherewithal to compete in all events. With the advent of the Concorde Agreements, this practice has been discontinued, though it did feature prominently in several world championships through the 1970s and 1980s, primarily in 1988 when Alain Prost scored a total of 105 points to Ayrton Senna's 94, but due to only the best 11 results counting towards the World Championship, Senna won, with the final points tally being 90\u201387.\n\n\n=== Current system ===\n\nPoints are awarded to drivers and teams based on where they finish in a race. The winner receives 25 points, the second-place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10, respectively. In a dead heat, prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie.:\u200aArt 7.1\u200a The winner of the annual championship is the driver (or team, for the Constructors' Championship) with the most points. If the number of points is the same, priority is given to the driver with more wins. If that is the same it will be decided on the most second places and so on.:\u200aArt 7.2\u200a\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCurrent Formula One Sporting Regulations \u2013 2020.

The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship).\nThis list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" were not always synonymous throughout history \u2013 see Formula One \u00a7 Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 at Silverstone; since then  77 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: N\u00fcrburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking N\u00fcrburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit. Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2012, nearly half were not on the calendar before 1999. The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in 1980, when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.  The Las Vegas Strip Circuit became the 77th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in 1957 it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.\nAs some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.\n\n\n== Circuits ==\n\nThe \"Circuit\" column uses the name contemporary to the last time the circuit was used in Formula One.\nThe \"Map\" column shows a diagram of the latest configuration on current tracks and the last configuration used on past tracks.\nThe \"Type\" column refers to the type of circuit: \"street\" is a circuit held on closed city streets, \"road\" refers to a mixture of public roads and a permanent track, and \"race\" is a permanent facility.\nThe \"Last length used\" shows the track length for the configuration that was used last time the Formula One race was held on a given track.\nThe \"Direction\" column shows the direction for the configuration that was used last time the Formula One race was held on a given track.\nThe turns column shows the number of turns for the configuration that was used the last time a Formula One race was held on a given track.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\n\nHughes, Mark; Tremayne, David (2002).

The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The World Drivers' Championship is presented by the FIA to the most successful Formula One driver over the course of the season through a points system based on individual Grand Prix results. The World Championship is won when it is no longer mathematically possible for another competitor to overtake their points total regardless of the outcome of the remaining races, although it is not officially awarded until the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony held in various cities following the conclusion of the season.\nMichael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton hold the record for the most World Drivers' Championships, both having won the title on seven occasions. Juan Manuel Fangio is third with five titles. Schumacher also holds the record for the most consecutive drivers' titles with five between the 2000 and the 2004 seasons. Nigel Mansell holds the record of competing in the highest number of seasons before winning the World Championship, entering Formula One in 1980 and achieving the title in 1992, a span of 13 seasons. Nico Rosberg has the highest number of Grand Prix starts before winning his first title, a period of 206 Grands Prix between the 2006 Bahrain and the 2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel is the youngest winner of the World Drivers' Championship; he was 23 years and 134 days old when he won the 2010 championship. Fangio is the oldest winner of the World Drivers' Championship; he was 46 years and 41 days old when he won the 1957 title.\nAs of the 2024 season, out of the 777 drivers who have started a Formula One Grand Prix, the 75 titles awarded have been won by a total of 34 different drivers. The first Formula One World Drivers' Champion was Giuseppe Farina in the 1950 championship and the current title holder is Max Verstappen in the 2024 season. The title has been won by drivers from the United Kingdom 20 times between 10 drivers, more than any other nation, followed by Brazil, Finland and Germany with three drivers each. The title has been won by drivers from Scuderia Ferrari 15 times between 9 drivers, more than any other team, followed by McLaren with 12 titles between 7 drivers. The Drivers' Championship has been won in the final race of the season 30 times in the 75 seasons it has been awarded. Schumacher holds the record of earning the championship with most Grands Prix left to run in a season with six when he won the 2002 title at that year's French Grand Prix.

The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The World Constructors' Championship is presented by the FIA to the most successful F1 constructor over the course of the season through a points system based on individual Grand Prix results. Constructors' Championship points are calculated by adding points scored in each race by any driver for that constructor. According to FIA regulations, the constructor of a chassis and an engine of a Formula One car is a person or corporate entity that owns the intellectual rights to the chassis and the engine of the car that a team/entrant enters into a competition.\nFrom the inaugural season of the World Constructors' Championship in 1958 up until the 1978 season only the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor contributed points towards the World Constructors' Championship (then officially as the International Cup for Formula One Constructors); since the 1979 season points from all cars entered by each constructor have counted towards their championship total. The Constructors' Championship is won when it is no longer mathematically possible for another constructor to overtake another's points total regardless of the outcome of the remaining races, although it is not officially awarded until the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony held in various cities following the conclusion of the season.\nThe Constructors' Championship was first awarded, as the International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers, in 1958 to Vanwall. In 1981 this name was officially changed to the World Constructors' Championship. The makes of both chassis and an engine are included in the constructor name.\nOut of the 170 chassis constructors that have entered an F1 Grand Prix, a total of 15 have won the Championship in its 63 seasons. Ferrari holds the record for the highest number of World Constructors' Championships victories, having won the title on 16 occasions. Williams and McLaren are in joint-second position with nine Constructors' Championships and Mercedes are in fourth with eight titles. With 16 titles, Ferrari has amassed the highest number of Constructors' Championships as an engine manufacturer, followed by Renault, Ford, Mercedes and Honda with twelve, ten, ten and six titles, respectively. Mercedes holds the record for the most consecutive constructors' titles with eight between the 2014 and the 2021 seasons. \nAll but 17 titles (16 titles won by Italian-built Ferrari chassis and 1 title won by French-built Matra chassis) have been won by chassis that were designed and constructed in the United Kingdom. On eleven occasions, the World Constructors' Champion team has not contained the World Drivers' Champion for that season. All titles but one  (in 1969 Matra cars entered by Ken Tyrrell's privateer team Matra International) have been won by cars that were entered by works teams. Among drivers that have contributed with at least a single point to the constructors' title, Lewis Hamilton has contributed to the most with eight constructors' titles, all of them with Mercedes.\n\n\n== By season ==\n\n\n== By chassis constructor ==\nConstructors in bold have competed in the 2025 World Championship.\n\n\n== By engine manufacturer ==\nEngine manufacturers in bold have competed in the 2025 World Championship.\n\n\n== By tyres used ==\nTyre manufacturers in bold have competed in the 2025 World Championship.\nThe table includes seasons in which a supplier won by default, as the only supplier in the series.

It was bought by Liberty Media in 2017.\nEcclestone, a former Formula One team boss, spent 40 years as chief executive of the company after gaining control of the commercial rights. As of January 2021, the group is run by Stefano Domenicali as president and chief executive officer. Chase Carey, who previously ran the group from 2017 to 2020, is non-executive chairman.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1974, the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA) was founded in order to increase commercial organisation of Formula One for the benefit of the racing teams. In 1978, Bernie Ecclestone became the executive of FOCA, and fought the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) for control of the commercial rights of F1. Disputes were settled by March 1981 when the Concorde Agreement gave FOCA the right to negotiate TV contracts. Under previous arrangements, TV contracts were risky and not very lucrative.\nWhen the second Concorde Agreement was agreed in 1987, Ecclestone ceased being a team owner and established Formula One Promotions and Administration (FOPA) to manage TV rights for the teams. FOPA would later become known as Formula One Management (FOM). FOPA received 49% of TV revenues: 1% went to the teams, and 50% to the FIA. FOPA also received all the fees paid by promoters and paid prize money to the teams. The third Concorde Agreement was signed in 1992.\nWhen the fourth Concorde Agreement was signed in 1995, the FIA decided to grant the commercial rights of F1 to Formula One Administration (managed by FOM) for a 14-year period. In exchange, Ecclestone would provide an annual payment. With FOM having exclusive rights to popular team names like McLaren, Williams, and Tyrrell, the aforementioned teams protested by rejecting the following Concorde Agreement in 1997. A compromise was reached and a new Concorde Agreement was signed by all teams in 1998.\nMcLaren, Williams, Ferrari and Renault formed GPWC Holdings, and threatened to form a rival racing franchise in 2008 when their contracts ended in 2007.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2478, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7790ff68-7d7c-40f8-a645-e2e1296be111": {"__data__": {"id_": "7790ff68-7d7c-40f8-a645-e2e1296be111", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2340306", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4292e3bcf233143751e218f465036afe4fce559c8d0e21fb752067621a7695fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4686ad83-e4f5-4558-891e-9fbc1035a52b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "622621981af6ee19088206427a73f8f8d3da4c290a1c8662461cfd96162eb760", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f491f2b-1c04-4fa3-b490-b0df13f0746c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27f5dbd8bcaafe94971e1994a99058e7e6c06a9b7f4cbfc649470abf7a9a3d1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Ecclestone sells shares of F1 ===\nSLEC Holdings was created as the holding company of the Formula One companies in 1996 when Ecclestone transferred his ownership of Formula One businesses to his wife, Slavica, in preparation for a 1997 flotation of the group.\nIn June 1999, the European Commission announced it would investigate the FIA, Formula One Administration (FOA) and International Sportsworld Communicators for abusing dominant position and restricting competition. ISC, owned by Ecclestone, had signed a 14-year agreement with the FIA in 1996 for the exclusive broadcasting rights for 18 FIA championships.\nIn October 1999, Morgan Grenfell Private Equity (MGPE) acquired 12.5% of SLEC for \u00a3234 million. In February 2000, Hellman and Friedman purchased a 37.5% share of SLEC for \u00a3625 million, and combined its share with that of MGPE to form Speed Investments, which had a combined holding of 50% of SLEC. On 22 March 2000, German media company EM.TV & Merchandising purchased Speed Investments for \u00a31.1 billion.\nEM.TV's acquisitions caused it financial difficulties; following its announcement that its 2000 earnings would be below expectations and it was struggling with its debts, the share price dropped 90%. In February, the Kirch Group agreed to rescue EM.TV in return for a stake in the company and control of Speed Investments. Alan Henry of The Guardian reported that the two companies also agreed to exercise EM.TV's option to purchase another 25% of SLEC for approximately \u00a3600 million in late-March 2001. To raise Speed Investments' share of SLEC to 75% Kirch borrowed \u20ac1.6 billion, \u20ac1 billion from Bayerische Landesbank (BayernLB) and the rest from Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase. Kirch's involvement raised concerns among the major automobile manufacturers who participate in Formula One; BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Fiat, Ford, and Renault formed GPWC Holding BV to secure better representation of the manufacturers in F1, improved financial conditions for the teams, stability for the championship, and maintenance of free-to-air television coverage.\nDue to the agreement associated with their shareholding, SLEC was controlled by Kirch, who controlled the board of Formula One Holdings (FOH). Due to huge losses and massive expenditure, Kirch's creditors put the company into receivership in 2002. These banks dismantled the group. Kirch's share of SLEC was retained by BayernLB, JPMorgan Chase and Lehman Brothers (through Speed Investments).\nBefore they could exercise their rights as shareholders, they had to seek clearance from the European Commission. In the intervening period, Ecclestone instituted changes in the boards of SLEC, FOH, FOA and Formula One Management (FOM); which in effect put Bambino Holdings in control of those companies.\nIn mid-November 2004, the three banks sued Ecclestone for more control over the sport, prompting speculation that Ecclestone might altogether lose the control he has maintained for then more than thirty years. A two-day court hearing began on 23 November, but after the proceedings had ended the following day, Justice Andrew Park announced his intention to reserve ruling for several weeks. On 6 December 2004, Park read his verdict, stating that \"In [his] judgment it is clear that Speed's contentions are correct and [he] should therefore make the declarations which it requests\". However, Ecclestone insisted that the verdict - seen almost universally as a legal blow to his control of Formula One - would mean \"nothing at all\". He stated his intention to appeal the decision.\nThe following day, at a meeting of team bosses at Heathrow Airport, Ecclestone offered the teams a total of \u00a3260 million over three years in return for unanimous renewal of the Concorde Agreement, which was due to expire in 2008. Weeks later, Gerhard Gribkowsky, a board member of BayernLB, and the chairman of SLEC, stated that the banks had no intention to remove Ecclestone from his position of control.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2481, "end_char_idx": 6444, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f491f2b-1c04-4fa3-b490-b0df13f0746c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f491f2b-1c04-4fa3-b490-b0df13f0746c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2340306", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4292e3bcf233143751e218f465036afe4fce559c8d0e21fb752067621a7695fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7790ff68-7d7c-40f8-a645-e2e1296be111", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7d615a42e75176ae394072e333e016c478027278fb0091ffc015e893531490d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14af92b3-5ac3-4e80-bae0-fe1e923d8592", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a454060c801c86c930b34afbe2b5e15f9dfdcbfdc3d27bdad8c2683f0e70a6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== CVC acquisition ===\nIn November 2005, CVC Capital Partners announced it was to acquire the 25% and 48% shares of Bambino and BayernLB in SLEC, and acquired the shares of JPMorgan Chase in December 2005. This deal was given approval by the European Commission on 21 March 2006 and finalised on 28 March. Ecclestone used the proceeds of the sale of Bambino Holdings' share to reinvest in the company to give the Ecclestone family a 13.8% stake in the holding company Alpha Prema. On 30 March 2006, CVC purchased the 14.1% share of SLEC held by Lehman Brothers to give CVC a majority ownership in the Formula One Group with 63.4%, with other shareholdings owned by LBI Group, JP Morgan, and company directors. The deputy team principal of Force India, Bob Fernley, accused CVC of \"raping the sport\" during the period of its involvement in Formula One.\nThe Formula One Group planned an initial public offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange in June 2012, valuing the company at $10 billion. Up to 30% of the company would be listed, with most of the stock coming from the shareholding owned by the creditors of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers. However, the flotation was delayed until October 2012, with Ecclestone citing volatile markets and problems in the Eurozone. CVC sold part of its stake in the company to three investment companies: Waddell & Reed, BlackRock and Norges Bank; reducing its holding to 35.5%, and making Waddell & Reed the second-biggest shareholder. The planned flotation was kept on hold throughout 2012, until it was revived in April 2013 when Ecclestone announced it would take place within the year.\n\n\n=== Liberty acquisition ===\nIn late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy controlling interest in the Formula One Group for $4.4 billion (\u00a33.3 billion).

The Formula One Group comprises several subsidiary companies which control the various rights, management, and licensing operations of the Formula One World Championship.\nThe commercial rights of Formula One are controlled by Formula One World Championship Limited (FOWC), which received the rights to Formula One for a period of 100 years from the FIA. Formula One World Championship's control of the rights began from the beginning of 2011, where it took over from sister company Formula One Administration (FOA), which controlled the rights for a 14-year period beginning in 1996. FOWC, as the commercial rights holder, negotiates the contracts for holding F1 Grands Prix, organising television contracts with broadcasters, and receiving licensing fees for use of Formula One material. The company also has a seat on the FIA World Motor Sport Council, the body responsible for regulating international motorsport. Formula One Licensing BV is a related Dutch registered company of the Formula One Group which claims ownership of the trademarks of Formula One; the F1 logo, \"Formula 1\", \"Formula One\", \"F1\" and the \"Sweeping Curves device\" shown before Grands Prix.\nFormula One Management (FOM) is the main operating company of the group, and controls the broadcasting, organisation and promotional rights of Formula One. The company produces the televised feeds of all Grand Prix sessions, which are then supplied through the Eurovision satellites network (EBU) to broadcasters who provide commentary and distribute the feed in the authorised region(s) of said broadcasters.  The production arm of FOM is based at Biggin Hill Airport, London, for easy travel of the equipment needed to broadcast the race. Financially, FOM provides partial investment for new tracks and teams, to allow them to establish themselves in the sport and grow Formula One's presence in new markets. The season calendar for the championship is structured by FOM, with the WMSC having oversight.  Payments to the teams are determined by the Concorde Agreement, which gives the teams 50% of the television money in Constructors' Championship order, and awards a prize fund to teams based upon their results, which is drawn from the fees Grand Prix promoters pay for staging the race. The logistics of moving equipment and personnel from each race is also handled by FOM, which provides the teams with a set amount of transport for the races outside of Europe.\nThe Formula One Group is also used to refer to several related companies, which although not part of the Group, are controlled by the Delta Topco holding company, and have business related to Formula One.\n\n\n=== Allsport Management ===\nAllsport Management S.A. is a Swiss registered company based in Geneva, which manages the sale of almost all Formula One trackside advertising, and the Formula One Paddock Club. Allsport Management was founded by Paddy McNally, who had begun to work with Bernie Ecclestone in the late 1970s. McNally, who was a former Marlboro sponsorship consultant, came up with a solution to \"tidy up\" trackside advertising; this solution was called \"themed advertising\", where one advertiser is given total exposure at one part of the track. This is in contrast to the Monaco Grand Prix, the only grand prix where Allsport is not involved; where space is sold such that multiple advertisers are visible in every picture. The Paddock Club is Formula One's corporate hospitality organisation, which provides a luxury area for VIP's and sponsors for the Grand Prix weekend, and also gives access to teams and drivers and tours of the pits.

Hamilton has won a joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles\u2014tied with Michael Schumacher\u2014and holds the records for most wins (105), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (202), among others.\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hamilton began his career in karting aged six, winning several national titles and attracting the attention of Ron Dennis, who signed him to the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme in 1998. After winning the direct-drive Karting World Cup and European Championship in 2000, Hamilton progressed to junior formulae, where his successes included winning the Formula 3 Euro Series and the GP2 Series. He subsequently signed for McLaren in 2007, becoming the first black driver to compete in Formula One at the Australian Grand Prix. In his rookie season, Hamilton won four Grands Prix and set several records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. Hamilton won his maiden title in 2008, making a title-deciding overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season to become the then-youngest World Drivers' Champion. Although McLaren was less successful in his remaining four seasons with the team, Hamilton achieved multiple race wins in each, including his involvement in a four-way title battle in 2010.\nHamilton signed for Mercedes in 2013 to partner his old karting teammate Nico Rosberg, ending his 15-year association with McLaren. Following his maiden victory with the team at the Hungarian Grand Prix, new engine regulations the following season saw Mercedes emerge as the dominant force in Formula One. Over the next three seasons, Hamilton and Rosberg won 51 of 59 Grands Prix amidst their fierce rivalry\u2014widely known as the Silver War\u2014with Hamilton winning the former titles in 2014 and 2015, and Rosberg winning the latter. After Rosberg's retirement, Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari to claim his fourth and fifth titles in 2017 and 2018. Hamilton won his sixth title in 2019, before breaking several records across his 2020 campaign\u2014including the all-time win record at the Portuguese Grand Prix\u2014to claim his record-equalling seventh. Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 race wins and pole positions in 2021, finishing runner-up to Max Verstappen amidst a controversial finish. Following winless campaigns in 2022 and 2023, he took his record-breaking ninth British Grand Prix victory in 2024, his twelfth and final season with Mercedes. Hamilton signed for Ferrari in 2025, and is contracted to remain in the team until at least the end of 2026.\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, amongst his environmental and social activism. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of racial justice and increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3188, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3363f3aa-3fcf-4729-a01c-990d826533bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "3363f3aa-3fcf-4729-a01c-990d826533bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb5ffa7b-ac38-426c-8634-2d87d3f46810", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d09d4f1789419307f5e7b538addf58452499dcd398f3ac43f36b18bc54b92ba0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b7d292e-8a5d-4d2c-a431-7c71a212a799", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "075ec2e649ba092d0c8a16c6d4417be172605469aa444800ae95a5afc31544e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Early life and education ==\n\nLewis Carl Davidson Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. His father, Anthony Hamilton, is of Afro-Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British from Birmingham, making him mixed-race. Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve. Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver. Hamilton was raised a Catholic.\nHamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five. Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition. Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse. Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents, while still attending his son's races. Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company. He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage. Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school. He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries. In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young. Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams. In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.\n\n\n== Junior racing career ==\n\n\n=== Karting ===\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships. Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\" Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\"\nWhen Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25. In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins, to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme. The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.\n\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000. In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher.

This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished third overall, and fifth in the Formula Renault Eurocup amidst only competing for four rounds. He remained with Manor for another year in Formula Renault UK, winning the championship in a dominant fashion ahead of Alex Lloyd, as he registered 10 wins from 15 races. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship. In his first race he was forced out with a puncture, and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\". He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix, and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix. Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not as BMW, their engine supplier at the time, refused to fund him. Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a \"huge row\" at the end of the season, with his father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in Formula 3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Hamilton's contract; however, Hamilton called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.\nHamilton had his first Formula One test with McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone. He moved to the reigning Euro Series champions, ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds and bragging 13 pole positions. He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort. Following his success, British magazine Autosport featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton at 24th.\n\n\n=== GP2 ===\nHamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. He secured a dominant win at the N\u00fcrburgring, amidst a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. At his home race in Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed corners where overtaking is considered to be rare. In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in 18th place to take second. Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.\n\n\n== Formula One career ==\n\n\n=== McLaren (2007\u20132012) ===\nHamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren-Mercedes following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen to Ferrari.

At the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Hamilton became the first\u2014and, as of 2025, only\u2014black driver to race in the series. After finishing third on debut, Hamilton went on to set several records, including the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the most wins in a debut season (4, shared with Jacques Villeneuve) and the most points in a debut season (109). Acquiring the championship lead as early as in the fourth round of the season, Hamilton became the youngest driver to lead the World Drivers' Championship. After a series of misfortunes in the latter half of the season, including strategic missteps by McLaren in the closing rounds and a retirement at the Chinese Grand Prix, Hamilton's 12-point advantage in the standings evanesced. He finished runner-up in the championship to R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point, classified ahead of teammate Alonso whilst finishing level on points. Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in several incidents, which resulted in inter-team tensions, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent. Hamilton signed a \u00a350 million contract to stay with the team until the end of 2012.\n\nPartnering Heikki Kovalainen for 2008, Hamilton's winning form continued as he amassed five race victories and 10 podium finishes. Ferrari drivers, along with BMW's Robert Kubica, emerged as his closest rivals, as they engaged in a close battle for the title with Hamilton during the first half of the season. At the rain-affected British Grand Prix, he won by over a minute from second-placed Nick Heidfeld, which was widely acclaimed as one of the greatest wet-weather performances in Formula One history. As the season progressed towards the closing rounds, the championship became a clear two-way fight between Hamilton and Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Hamilton won his maiden title at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth-place at the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest World Drivers' Champion, and deny race-winner Massa the title by one point. Hamilton also became the first British driver to win the World Drivers' Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10400, "end_char_idx": 13385, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a492aa61-bb54-45f5-90a2-15f6ad7f50e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a492aa61-bb54-45f5-90a2-15f6ad7f50e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a63214c-ebb3-4523-b881-a751d85006e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfbd52ffd8a99af6f9e493fa61c3a545d5da5113655957a7550a81954b54d267", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1bbfcac5-1b5b-4ba9-8c46-3194b550f7c5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "48bd3ecd26cefc9ae94103bc4e5909d8f3d90b7f4328a336d840fc1b66c32f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "==== 2009\u20132012: Unsuccessful title bids and departure from McLaren ====\nDuring his veering final years with McLaren\u2014a period largely dominated by Red Bull\u2014Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, and challenged for titles. Major technical regulation changes in 2009 led to a challenging start for McLaren. Often qualifying outside of the top ten, and struggling to finish consistently on points, Hamilton's chances of defending his title became unfeasible. Major upgrades at the German Grand Prix saw a dramatic improvement in performance of the MP4-24 car. From that point onward, Hamilton advanced from eleventh to fifth in the standings and outscored the rest of the field, securing two race victories and three additional podium finishes across the remaining nine rounds.\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton was partnered by reigning World Drivers' Champion Jenson Button. Whilst McLaren struggled to match the outright pace of Red Bull and Ferrari, Hamilton engaged in a four-way title battle with Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber throughout the season. At the Canadian Grand Prix, he secured McLaren's only pole position of the season, and took the championship lead after winning the race. Hamilton's latter half of the season unravelled with a number of misfortunes, including race-ending collisions and mechanical failures, culminated in him losing vital points to his rivals, and ultimately, the championship lead. He entered the final round of the season with an outside chance of winning the title, but finished fourth in the standings as Vettel won his maiden title. \n2011 was a challenging year for Hamilton, marking the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Button finished runner-up to Vettel. Setbacks in his private life, as well as on-track collisions culminating in multiple run-ins with the stewards, contributed to his inconsistent performances throughout the season. Hamilton finished fifth in the standings with three race wins; he secured the only non-Red Bull pole position of the season at the Korean Grand Prix, and vowed he would return to form. \nIn 2012, McLaren emerged as contenders for the title, with Hamilton remaining in title contention during the first half of the season. Akin to the 2010 season, he endured a challenging latter half of the season, with inconsistent results and a series of mechanical failures. Across those ten races, Hamilton encountered five retirements, three whilst leading. Ultimately, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings, achieving four race wins and a season-highest seven pole positions. Motorsport.com analysis found that Hamilton had lost an estimated 110 points due to race retirements and other misfortunes. Prior to the end of the year, having denied multiple renegotiations with McLaren, Hamilton announced\u2014to widespread surprise\u2014that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season.

In his first season with the Brackley-based team\u2014amidst Mercedes W04's tyre management struggles\u2014Hamilton finished fourth in the standings, securing five podium finishes and pole positions, with only one converted into a race victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Whilst Pirelli's switch in tyre construction contributed to his victory in Hungary, Hamilton and Mercedes endured a difficult latter half of the season, as he only managed to achieve one podium finish for the rest of the year.\nChanges to engine regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. Mercedes won 16 of the 19 races held that season; Hamilton secured a career-best 11 victories as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. After securing a streak of wins and acquiring the championship lead, Hamilton endured a number of misfortunes mid-season, including mechanical failures and a collision with Rosberg which culminated in a retirement from the Belgian Grand Prix, saw him trailing Rosberg by 29 points in the standings. Following a run of five consecutive race victories towards the end of the season, Hamilton clinched his second World Drivers' Championship at the final round in Abu Dhabi, and declared it was \"the greatest day of [his] life\" over team radio.\nOpting to continue racing with his old karting number 44, Hamilton fended off Rosberg's challenge for the title for a second year running in 2015, winning 10 races from a then-joint record 17 podium finishes, scoring 11 pole positions in the first 12 races, and leading the championship throughout the season, he achieved his first back-to-back championships. His rivalry with Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the United States Grand Prix, where Hamilton clinched the title with three races to spare. Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than \u00a3100 million; the deal allowed Hamilton to retain his own image rights and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.\n\nAfter another season-long duel for the title in 2016, Hamilton finished runner-up in the championship to Rosberg by five points. He endured a challenging start to the season, as a succession of poor race-starts and mechanical failures culminated in him being marginally behind Rosberg in the standings. Mercedes' policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges on-track, culminating in collisions at the Spanish and Austrian Grands Prix. Hamilton won six of seven races mid-season, including the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he overtook his teammate to the championship lead for the first time of the season. After a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia, Hamilton secured a hat-trick of wins\u2014including his 50th race victory in United States, and 100th podium finish in Japan\u2014to enter the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, 12 points adrift of Rosberg. In Abu Dhabi, Hamilton defied team orders\u2014deliberately slowing Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race, in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate. Rosberg took the title before announcing his shock retirement from the sport, immediately after beating his rival.

Following the summer break, benefitting from Vettel's misfortunes and Mercedes' resurgence, Hamilton dominated the subsequent races, winning five in six, including the Italian Grand Prix where he broke the record for all-time most pole positions, and overtook Vettel for the championship lead for the first time of the season.

Beginning from the German Grand Prix\u2014where Vettel made an error while leading and retired, and Hamilton won starting from 14th on the grid\u2014Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver errors in the following races. Meanwhile, Hamilton repeated his run of consecutive wins to clinch his fifth title at the Mexican Grand Prix for a second year running. Securing a total of 11 pole positions and race victories from 17 podium finishes, he set a new record for most points scored in a season (408). During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to \u00a340 million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.\nHamilton led the championship standings for the majority of 2019, whilst benefitting from Mercedes' dominant performances during the first half of the season, he fended off title challenges from teammate Bottas, and remained unchallenged amidst Ferrari's sturdy performances following the summer break. Hamilton clinched his sixth title at the United States Grand Prix with two races remaining. After scoring his sixth career grand slam at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the season finale, Hamilton ended the season with 11 race wins in 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time), and broke his own record for most points by scoring a total of 413 points, 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.\nHamilton dominated the 2020 season to win his seventh Drivers' title, equalling the record for most titles set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton secured 10 pole positions and 11 race victories (equalling his previous personal best for the fifth time, in fewer races) including one from the Portuguese Grand Prix, where he achieved his 92nd career win and broke the record for all-time most wins. Hamilton missed the Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19, his first race absence since his debut in 2007.

Amidst their intense battle for the title, the pair engaged in several on-track battles\u2014culminating in collisions in Britain, Italy and Saudi Arabia\u2014and finished 1\u20132 at 14 of 22 Grands Prix. Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win at the Spanish and Russian Grands Prix, respectively, becoming the first driver to achieve either feat. Securing a hat-trick of wins in the penultimate rounds, including a recovery drive at the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix\u2014which was acclaimed as one of his greatest performances\u2014Hamilton eliminated a 19-point deficit to Verstappen to enter the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix level on points. In Abu Dhabi, having led the majority of the race, Hamilton was denied the championship by a last-lap overtake from Verstappen following a late safety car. During the year, Hamilton extended his \u00a340 million per year contact with Mercedes for two additional years.\nThe season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi's decision to instruct the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which closed the gap between the pair and allowed Verstappen, who opted to pit for soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton, who remained on worn hard tyres. Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident. Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director, with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, adding that the final standings are \"valid, final and cannot now be changed\". Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with Hamilton and Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders\u2014and a lot more\u2014clear of every other driver on the grid\".", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 23785, "end_char_idx": 26066, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1212f34c-3b87-46a3-bd8a-90bcb8813dcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1212f34c-3b87-46a3-bd8a-90bcb8813dcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e59e34f5-8e9c-4d02-9fdc-bc3e7ad3ba88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99fde47218794c566c7e78a5ccae3386af3a5d73358503739b91eb73e12fe48a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f953aaa-34ed-4079-88ea-d580afb1bc5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "003ac1c35b57a04378b18dc39012c18ced31c4ba80ba02648919372148dbe3df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "==== 2022\u20132024: Mercedes' struggles and departure ====\n\nPartnered by George Russell in place of the departing Bottas, the 2022 season marked the first time in Hamilton's Formula One career that he did not secure a race win or a pole position. Significant changes in technical regulations saw Hamilton and Mercedes endure a challenging campaign, as the innovative and radically different W13 car suffered with porpoising throughout the season, leading him to deem it \"undrivable\" and causing him to sustain a back injury at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. He frequently experimented with car setups to aid the W13's development during the opening stages of the season. Following major mid-season car upgrades, Hamilton achieved several podium finishes. Hamilton set several records across his sixteenth season, including most consecutive seasons with a podium finish, and at least one lap led. The season also marked the first time Hamilton finished behind his teammate in the standings since 2016, finishing sixth, 35 points behind Russell in fourth.\nMercedes once again faced concerns over their car's competitiveness ahead of the 2023 season. Hamilton endured another winless campaign amidst Red Bull dominance, securing several podium finishes throughout and finishing third in the standings. He took his record ninth pole at the Hungarian Grand Prix\u2014his first since 2021\u2014surpassing Senna and Schumacher for the most pole positions at the same Grand Prix. Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension worth over \u00a3100 million to remain with Mercedes.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2024 season, Hamilton triggered an exit-clause in his contract, allowing him to leave Mercedes at the end of his campaign, a year before his contract was due to expire. Having been associated with the German marque since the age of 13, Hamilton explained the decision was one of his hardest to make, adding that he needed a new challenge and a different work environment. Mercedes' inconsistent form, coupled with Hamilton's difficulties in adapting to the W15 car\u2014whose characteristics struggled to mesh with his driving style\u2014led to inconsistent qualifying performances, resulting in another challenging season in 2024. Mercedes' short-lived resurgence during mid-season enabled him to deliver his ninth British Grand Prix victory, ending his 31-month winless drought; he broke the record for most wins at the same Grand Prix and became the first driver to win beyond their 300th start. Hamilton secured his 200th podium finish in Hungary, and another victory at the Belgian Grand Prix. After a series of races with fluctuating results, admitting he was \"looking forward to the end [of the season]\", Hamilton ended the season a career-lowest seventh in the championship\u201422 points behind teammate Russell\u2014marking the end of his Mercedes career, which was the most successful driver-constructor partnership in Formula One history by several metrics.\n\n\n=== Ferrari (2025 onwards) ===\n\nFollowing the announcement of his departure from Mercedes, Ferrari announced they had reached a multi-year agreement with Hamilton to join the team in 2025, on a contract reported to be worth more than \u00a340 million per year, replacing Carlos Sainz Jr. to partner Charles Leclerc. Hamilton stated it had been a \"childhood dream\" to drive for Ferrari. In parallel to his move from McLaren to Mercedes in 2013, it was noted as one of the most unexpected driver transfers in Formula One history, and marked the first time in his career where he did not drive for a Mercedes-powered team. He finished tenth on debut at the Australian Grand Prix after a strategic error. Hamilton then took his maiden sprint victory in China, before being disqualified from sixth in the main race for excessive skid block wear. Finishing behind Leclerc at each of the opening six Grands Prix, Hamilton described his early-season struggles as \"painful\".\n\n\n== Driver profile ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26069, "end_char_idx": 29980, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f953aaa-34ed-4079-88ea-d580afb1bc5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f953aaa-34ed-4079-88ea-d580afb1bc5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1212f34c-3b87-46a3-bd8a-90bcb8813dcc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "79545aa1f163721670e79a73f0333cb8ec9bc125bcdc78278e627e9ddbe2ae61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5044d4ae-b352-428e-9ae5-8ce8cbbfc856", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72eab9ebfee328c2b15b7749dee74b160d45389ff90b2076d5d24f6680841065", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Driver profile ==\n\n\n=== Driving style ===\n\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid, excelling across a wide range of areas. He has been described as having an aggressive driving style, with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car. Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\" Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.\nHamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners. Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.\nHamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues. Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\" Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"\n\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen. His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\". Qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place. Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.\n\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\" He has been compared to Senna in raw speed. In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show Top Gear. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia. Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".\n\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nHamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation, and one of the greatest Formula One drivers including by Chase Carey and Martin Brundle.

Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time. Writing in Autocar, Jim Holden suggested Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One but one of the greatest British sportsmen. Amongst receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been underappreciated. Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance\u2014being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, braids and designer clothing\u2014alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase. Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.\n\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised. He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers. Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore. His Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.\nFigures in the sport, such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner, have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, observing how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers. In 2019, The Telegraph sports journalist Luke Slater went as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\" Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020, newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton is \"a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car\".\n\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\" After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation. Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport. In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons, attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.\n\nAfter Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\". As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history. The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history. After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals, and teammates alike, including among others Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz Jr., Felipe Massa, Gerhard Berger, and Ross Brawn. Some journalists and pundits also consider the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34497, "end_char_idx": 39355, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79028b7c-58a3-4d4f-b68e-ff1d9cd5d6d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "79028b7c-58a3-4d4f-b68e-ff1d9cd5d6d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5044d4ae-b352-428e-9ae5-8ce8cbbfc856", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72eab9ebfee328c2b15b7749dee74b160d45389ff90b2076d5d24f6680841065", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd3b377d-7a7b-44ee-bad8-da88b2531304", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26af0fb43b271f2e493e23b62f90c8e46ab59ecb19d1de4c25354b000b587ba8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.

Some journalists and pundits also consider the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.\nFollowing Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever, while Formula One staff writer Greg Stuart described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\". After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.\n\n\n=== Helmet ===\n\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years, a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space. Hamilton continued to run a yellow design throughout the early stages of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to switch to a white design with three red ribbons on the side. In 2016, Hamilton added three stars beneath the ribbons, representing each of his World Drivers' Championships. Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions in 2017; the winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details. Over the following seasons, Hamilton began a tradition of adding more stars to his helmet upon winning each title. Having switched back to a 2014-inspired white-and-red design in 2018, Hamilton opted a different colour palette in 2020, which used matte black as base colour with purple details; he later added a Black Lives Matter emblem to the lid, in support of the movement. In 2022, he moved to a fluorescent yellow design, retaining the purple details and championship stars. Upon signing with Ferrari in 2025, Hamilton reverted to a design reminiscent of the early stages of his Formula One career, featuring yellow as the base color along with red accents and championship stars, complemented by the Ferrari emblem replacing the Mercedes logo.\n\nHamilton has used several one-off helmet designs across his career. Hamilton sported gold helmets for season finales three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words \"World Champion\". He used similar designs in 2018 and 2019 with five and six stars, respectively. This practice altered in 2020, when Hamilton wore his base helmet with gold outlines and accents, instead of a full gold design.\n\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to his influential figures. He has continuously brought special helmet designs to Brazilian Grands Prix, in tribute to Ayrton Senna. Prior to the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, three-time world champion and Mercedes team personnel Niki Lauda, who played pivotal role in Hamilton's move to Mercedes, died. In tribute, Hamilton wore a special helmet design featuring Lauda's classic red-and-white palette with his name printed on the back, honoring the influence Lauda had on his career. Other notable special designs include his rainbow helmet designs\u2014used during the Qatar, Saudi Arabian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix of 2021\u2014in support of LGBTQ rights in the Middle East. Hamilton used unique designs for the Japanese Grand Prix in 2022 and 2023, designed by Japanese artists Takashi Murakami and Hajime Sorayama, respectively.\n\n\n=== Rivalries ===", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38541, "end_char_idx": 42978, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd3b377d-7a7b-44ee-bad8-da88b2531304": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd3b377d-7a7b-44ee-bad8-da88b2531304", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "79028b7c-58a3-4d4f-b68e-ff1d9cd5d6d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "272ec1a1b0e01642f5de77fa58e697eb7f6dbf785d1a5900bc93e239af810a59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0bd5416-0076-4b78-9c6b-f8d79ac2a484", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70152a987d5210fbb8af8fe57ab228d53435572b12d7b5b39cd4e8115218050e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Rivalries ===\n\n\n==== Fernando Alonso ====\n\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007. After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary. Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session. Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points. Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident. British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\"; however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period. In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008. The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season; Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates. In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown, with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\" Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time. On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.\nWhilst teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won eight of 17 races held. Both drivers achieved four victories and 12 podium finishes, whilst Hamilton outqualified Alonso 10 of 17 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 42961, "end_char_idx": 46550, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0bd5416-0076-4b78-9c6b-f8d79ac2a484": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0bd5416-0076-4b78-9c6b-f8d79ac2a484", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd3b377d-7a7b-44ee-bad8-da88b2531304", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26af0fb43b271f2e493e23b62f90c8e46ab59ecb19d1de4c25354b000b587ba8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f73d469f-bb24-47f2-b124-99e745c9f656", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed1955b928bcc76a6ae09bc7433ce07f7fe82094962943225418f815300752ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "==== Nico Rosberg ====\n\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track. Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\" Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings; Rosberg was born in Germany and raised in Monaco as the son of 1982 World Drivers' Champion Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was raised on a council estate in Stevenage to a father who worked multiple jobs to fund his son's early karting career.\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability, as well as an intellect to match Rosberg's. Buxton wrote:\n\nMan to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical. This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management, and moderate fuel usage. Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times, while Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.\n\n\n==== Sebastian Vettel ====\n\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together. After three years of Mercedes's dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018. Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty, the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight. In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\nMine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.\n\n\n=== Public image and influence ===", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 46553, "end_char_idx": 50959, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f73d469f-bb24-47f2-b124-99e745c9f656": {"__data__": {"id_": "f73d469f-bb24-47f2-b124-99e745c9f656", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0bd5416-0076-4b78-9c6b-f8d79ac2a484", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70152a987d5210fbb8af8fe57ab228d53435572b12d7b5b39cd4e8115218050e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b235c2cf-29aa-4a3d-99ec-850265ba2b03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c70eb7b32d295c051197f75cff56bbecc2169ca8d3a5a7cde200f131cde192e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Public image and influence ===\n\n\n==== Racist treatment ====\n\nThe first and as of 2025 the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix. In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [sic]\". The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour, and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign. Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named pinchalaruedadeHamilton, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults. In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, The Guardian journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public. In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button. At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\", and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport. In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50925, "end_char_idx": 53289, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b235c2cf-29aa-4a3d-99ec-850265ba2b03": {"__data__": {"id_": "b235c2cf-29aa-4a3d-99ec-850265ba2b03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "675561", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "836f6ed7f6b9b2b3f5fc602be1227cd12c5a0adb79ffa8e5fe4670f6b7afe02c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f73d469f-bb24-47f2-b124-99e745c9f656", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed1955b928bcc76a6ae09bc7433ce07f7fe82094962943225418f815300752ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b26782b7-46b2-4f1f-b8f0-4d64b2371594", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67f0970b9d8d9e54ff5904d09a4a79cc3aa4354bb4f768c83dafd84b7979b8ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "==== Media reception ====\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and observed that people felt \"very offended\". Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying: \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\" The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".\n\nHamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the Powerlist, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017. In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th Powerlist, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2020, he was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008. That year, Hamilton received criticism from members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes. Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying \u00a33.3 million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth \u00a316.5 million. According to BBC Panorama, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips. The jet was sold in September 2019. Whilst not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told The Sunday Times in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot [in the UK] as well.

Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:\n\nI see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars [sic] yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I'm one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. [...] I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can't stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you. [...] We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.\nFollowing Hamilton's comments, several drivers and team executives reciprocated his views. Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, stated that the organisation \"supports [Hamilton] totally\", describing Hamilton as \"a great ambassador for the sport\". During the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a t-shirt stating \"arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\". Following an investigation, the FIA barred drivers from wearing unofficial attire on the podium and in media interviews. In anticipation of the FIA's decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have \"certain limits that they feel that they have to work within\", but he \"[didn't] regret a single moment of it\" and appreciated the \"really positive support from the fans\".\nIn June 2020, Hamilton established The Hamilton Commission with the Royal Academy of Engineering, tasked with finding ways for motorsport to engage more black people with STEM subjects and increase employment in motorsport or other engineering sectors.

Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport by improving opportunities in education and offering financial support.\n\n\n==== Human rights ====\nIn December 2020, Hamilton confronted human rights in Bahrain and spoke out on allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy wrote a letter to Hamilton asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty after making an alleged forced confession. Hamilton discussed the case with human rights organisations and legal experts, as well as Bahraini officials. He stated that whilst he has no authority over where he competes, drivers should not \"[go] to these countries and just [ignore] what is happening\". \nHamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix for their anti-LGBT law.

The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\" In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism. The same year Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\". \nHamilton used the number 44 in karts, as his father's Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" when he started racing; it was his father's idea to use it. New Formula One driver number regulations brought in for the 2014 season allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for the remainder of their careers, with Hamilton electing to compete under his old karting number 44. Before the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44.

This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton's own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group's application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to \"fair competition\" in relation to 44IP's existing \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" mark. In 2020 the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP's arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP's \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" trade mark did not extend to the word \"HAMILTON\" alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.\n\n\n=== Residence ===\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland, in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK.
